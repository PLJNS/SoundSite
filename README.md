Overview
--------

SoundSite is a Jekyll boilerplate and CMS for record labels and artists
to publish their content without writing any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.
It comes complete with Photoshop templates for artists, releases,
radio shows, and featured entries intro a full-width carousel.

SoundSite allows a content curator to define artists,
events, social links, radio shows, releases, and merch products
using easy-to-learn YML, then enter in their content into well-named
asset folders, and leave the rest to SoundSite to build your website.

Used in conjunction with GitHub Pages, SoundSite offers a free
platform for record labels and artists to publish their content.

Some UI features of SoundSite include:

-   A full-width carousel landing page, with templates for featured:
	-   Artists
