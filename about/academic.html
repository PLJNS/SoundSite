Transferring to Rutgers University in the ensuing Spring of 2012, I declared as both a Computer Science and Philosophy major. I am an active member of the Rutgers undergraduate philosophy community, holding leadership positions in the Philosophy Club, Undergraduate Journal, and Philosophy Honors Society.
