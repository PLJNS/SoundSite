<p>I was born in June of 1993 in Birmingham, England into an English/Irish home. After three years and my sister was born, my family moved to Fleurey-Sur-Ouche, France, where we would spend the next four years. My family moved to the United States of America in 2000, and we settled in New Jersey. In 2012, I became a proud citizen of my adopted country. Now, I live in New Brunswick, NJ.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<div class="large-8 columns">
<p>In my spare time, I try to live well and fully. There is something profoundly human about music, and I try to maintain and develop my ability to express myself musically. I've been playing guitar since I was quite little, and have been in assorted musical groups over the years. There's also something innate about the great outdoors: my friends and I will occasionally leave civilization to appreciate nature for a few days. Similarly, I like physically pushing my body with a good run. Another important part of living well is the food you eat, because as programmers will tell you, GIGO. So more recently I've taken an interest in cooking and nutrition, I try to cook my own meals from scratch more often than not.</p>
