<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 columns">
<p>I was hired by Local Wisdom in May of 2012 to work in Research and Development, namely their Weatherwise and Photomash applications. For the current Weatherwise 2.0, I implemented the Theme Store, where users can purchase different themes for the app. For the upcoming Weatherwise 3.0 update, I implemented the app's animation engine across platforms and a Mac application to create Weatherwise themes. I have also worked with the Green Party of New Jersey, student organizations, and friends in building websites.</p>

<h2>Weatherwise</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="large-12 columns">
<p>I'm proud of all the good work that I've done with all the good people at Local Wisdom in my time there, but one of the projects I'm most proud to be a part of is Weatherwise. It's a themed weather application for iOS and Android, and it is crafted with love and attention. Below is a video that'll show you what I mean!</p>
