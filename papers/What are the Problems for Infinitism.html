title: What are the Problems for Infinitism?
subtitle: Seniors Honors Thesis
---

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this essay is to: (1) interpret infinitism and its objections, (2) to defend infinitism from those objections, and (3) to identify a new response which does not suffer from the same problems as those objections. First, this work will interpret infinitism and Peter Klein's Interrogation Argument. Specifically, as it is found in &quot;Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons&quot; and &quot;Infinitism is the Solution to the Regress Problem.&quot; Second, this work will interpret and respond to objections to the arguments found in those works. Specifically, the objections considered come from Carl Ginet's &quot;Infinitism is not the Solution to the Regress Problem&quot; and Michael Bergmann's &quot;Is Klein an infinitist about doxastic justification?&quot;. Finally, this work will raise an objection to the Interrogation Argument and examine how this objection fits into the rest of the dialogue. Specifically, there may be meta-epistemological priors at the heart of the disagreement presented, and that there is reason to disagree.</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-infinitism">Interpreting Infinitism</h2>
<p>My approach to interpreting infinitism will be to first set up the problem it is taken to solve, followed by an identification of key notions and principles, and conclude with Klein's argument for it.</p>
<h3 id="the-regress-problem">The Regress Problem</h3>
<p>Infinitism is an answer to the epistemological puzzle known as <em>The Regress Problem</em>. To get an understanding of what that is, take any belief of your own. Ask yourself, what reason do you have for believing this? And continue to do so with every subsequent justifying belief. The Regress Problem asks, what will be the structure of those responses? Especially, what is the right structure? More precisely, how do we become justified in believing anything, if at all? The way that Klein formulates this question in his chapter of <em>Contemporary Debates in Epistemology</em> is like so,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(RP) &quot;Which type of series of reasons and the account of [justification] associated with it can increase the credibility of a non-evident proposition?&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are four possibilities: The series of reasons that can increase the credibility of a non-evident proposition ...</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Will have a <em>foundational</em> reason;</li>
<li>Will be a <em>coherent</em> set of reasons;</li>
<li>Will be <em>infinitely</em> long;</li>
<li>Does not exist, so we should be <em>skeptical</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The argument pattern for many of these positions is <em>eliminative</em> in that a view is endorsed after the arguer eliminates all other options and posits that justification is possible. Therefore, because it is possible and there is only one tenable view, it must that view. Klein argues this way, showing that neither a foundational approach nor a coherentist approach can solve (RP), and leaving skepticism for discussion elsewhere <span class="citation">(P. Klein and Ginet 2014, 2428)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="doxastic-vs.-propositional-justification">Doxastic vs. Propositional Justification</h3>
<p>An important distinction to make in giving a solution to The Regress Problem is between, roughly, what it takes for a <em>proposition</em> to be justified and what it takes for a <em>doxastic attitude</em> to be justified. For instance, after considering the sentence &quot;Santa Clause does not exist.&quot;, you will be doxastically justified in believing the proposition that the sentence expresses because you, hopefully, have good epistemic grounds for the attitude you are taking. But before you considered it, there was <em>some sense</em> in which you had the epistemic prerequisites, that is, you were already <em>propositionally</em> justified, even if you did not hold any occurrent doxastic attitude at that time. To be more precise, consider these &quot;Hempel-style&quot; variables. (RP) is about the state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(S\)</span> knows that <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowledge may or may not have sufficient conditions, but there is some stronger agreement amongst mainstream epistemologists that there are at least necessary conditions:<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(S\)</span> knows that <span class="math">\(p\)</span> <span class="math">\(\to\)</span> <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is justified in believing the truth that <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distinction lies in the important ambiguity that exists in the terms &quot;believing&quot; and &quot;justified.&quot; If we say that &quot;<span class="math">\(S\)</span> is justified in believing <span class="math">\(p\)</span>,&quot; it could mean that either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If <span class="math">\(S\)</span> were to believe <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math">\(S\)</span> would be justified.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(S\)</span> does believe <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is justified.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first sense is the <em>propositional</em> sense of justification, the subject being the proposition of the belief state. The second sense is about <em>doxastic</em> justification, which refers just to the belief state. To say that &quot;<span class="math">\(S\)</span> is justified in believing <span class="math">\(p\)</span>&quot; could mean either that <em>the proposition</em> is justified or that <em>the belief is justified</em>. The distinction also captures that a believer might have justification for some proposition, that is have the doxastic sort, but the propositions believed does not actually transfer justification, that is have the propositional sort of justification.</p>
<p>So which is important to the argument presented here for the infinitist solution to (RP)? Well, perhaps both, but at least doxastic justification is necessary for anyone to be justified at all. In &quot;Infinitism is the Solution to the Regress Problem&quot;, Klein's objections to foundationalism and coherentism, as we will see, concern doxastic justification because the case concerns actual epistemic agents occurently holding propositional beliefs. (RP) is most directly about this variety of justification, because knowledge is not just about how propositions can be related justifiably but about how <em>believed</em> propositions can be related justifiably.</p>
<h3 id="transfer-vs.-emergent-justification">Transfer vs. Emergent Justification</h3>
<p>An important notion to understanding the infinitist position is <em>emergence</em>, and specifically an emergent property. On its own it is perhaps a metaphysical concept, it is epistemology when a certain epistemological property like justification is said to be emergent. To get an intuitive grasp of what an emergent property is, consider some phenomena like, &quot;animal.&quot; A biological cell on its own is not an animal, any single organ or even organ system does not constitute an animal, the property of being an animal <em>emerges</em> out of many animal cells and organs working in a certain functional relationship to one another.</p>
<p>What relevance does this emergence have for justification? First, lets consider the conventional view of justification-transfer and see how this emergence might inform an alternative. Foundationalists think that justification is a property of a single proposition that &quot;flows&quot; from the justified foundational belief to all the others via some proper rules for reasoning. Foundationalist hold that justification originates in that basic proposition and is <em>transferred</em> to epistemically latter propositions.</p>
<p>But coherentists cannot hold this view. The coherent approach to responding to (RP) views the proper series of reasons as one which &quot;loops&quot; in on itself. If justification is transferred in the same way as in justification-transfer foundationalism, then coherentists think the proper mode of reasoning is circular, and as Klein points out, no philosopher could accept this <span class="citation">(P. Klein and Ginet 2014, 2435)</span>. The account that coherentists give is that justification is a property of <em>a set</em> of propositions, that justification <em>emerges</em> from a set of beliefs. The justification-emergent view is that justification is a property of a set of propositions and not any particular proposition.</p>
<p>What reason is there for thinking that justification is a property of a set of propositions and not any particular proposition? Consider these two propositions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No human is a horse.</li>
<li>Plato is not a horse.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that if one were to take &quot;Plato is not a horse.&quot; to be the questioned proposition, and your justifying reason was that &quot;No human is a horse.&quot;, the statements mutually support one another. Plato's not being a horse makes it more likely that no human is a horse and no human being a horse makes it more likely that Plato is not a horse. If you have a list of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> humans and their statuses as horses, then the propositions in the set would all mutually support one another in this way. The rational credence for every member of the set would raise with every subsequent &quot;<span class="math">\(X\)</span> is not a horse.&quot; proposition. This is how justification can be emergent.</p>
<p>The logical space of possible views is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Justification-transfer foundationalism;</li>
<li>Justification-emergent foundationalism;</li>
<li>Justification-transfer coherentism;</li>
<li>Justification-emergent coherentism;</li>
<li>Justification-transfer infinitism;</li>
<li>Justification-emergent infinitism.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason that (2) is not a tenable view is that a justification-emergent foundationalism will posit that &quot;justification emerges from a chain of reasoning with a foundational reason&quot;, and that is to just say that the foundational reason confers, that is transfers, justification. Alternatively, the set of propositions is not justified until it has the foundational reason, so justification may as well be a property of the foundational reason. Justification-transfer coherentism, that is (3), is not a tenable view because it endorses a thinly-disguised form of circular reasoning. The reason we should discount (5) is that it would be arbitrary in practice, some epistemic prior would always be posited to have the justificatory power. But never mind, perhaps it is a view that could be argued for, but as we shall see, it is not the view Klein argues for. The views still on the table, then, are (1), (4), and (6).</p>
<p>So which account does Klein's infinitism use? Here is Klein on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infinitism is like the warrant-emergent form of coherentism because it holds that [justification] for a questioned proposition emerges as the proposition becomes embedded in a set of propositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He endorses (5), then. His argument, described below, will be eliminative and have the following form:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We can be justified.</li>
<li>(2), (3), and (5) are not tenable.</li>
<li>We cannot practice (1) and (4).</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\therefore\)</span> The correct view is (6).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="doxastic-justification-emergence">Doxastic Justification Emergence</h3>
<p>(RP), as we saw in the previous subsection, is concerned first and foremost with doxastic justification, and concerned with propositional justification only through it. Of emergent justification, Klein says that &quot;[justification] for a questioned proposition emerges as the proposition becomes embedded in a set of propositions.&quot; In &quot;Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons&quot;, Klein endorses the view that <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is <em>doxastically justified</em> in <span class="math">\(p\)</span> if and only if &quot;<span class="math">\(S\)</span> has engaged in tracing the reasons in virtue of which the proposition <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is justified far enough forward to satisfy the contextually determined requirements.&quot; How are these two views related?</p>
<p>To demonstrate how they are related, consider this abstract reasoning session where I will point out each notion at work and then generalize into a principle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ivan: <span class="math">\(p\)</span></p>
<p>Doris: Why believe that <span class="math">\(p\)</span>?</p>
<p>Ivan: <span class="math">\(r_1\)</span></p>
<p>Doris: Why believe that <span class="math">\(r_1\)</span>?</p>
<p>Ivan: <span class="math">\(r_2\)</span></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Doris: Why believe that <span class="math">\(r_{n - 1}\)</span>?</p>
<p>Ivan: <span class="math">\(r_n\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the notion of justification emergence has to say about this dialogue is that justification is a property of the following set: <span class="math">\(\lbrace p, r_1, r_2, ..., r_n \rbrace\)</span>. The notion of doxastic justification plays the role of determining how many beliefs need be in the set for Ivan to have knowledge that <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, that is <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Perhaps in a low-standards context only a few are required, but in high-standards contexts perhaps hundreds are needed. Where these notions overlap in a single reasoning session opens some interesting questions. For instance, if Ivan has successfully traced the number of reasons to satisfy a high-standards contexts for knowledge, must he doxastically hold all of the beliefs in the chain? Or can he &quot;doxastically drop&quot; some of the reasons in the middle of the chain while maintaining <em>propositionally</em> justified in those reasons? The view, taken together, is something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(S\)</span> is justified in <span class="math">\(p\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(S\)</span> has embedded <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in a set of believed propositions by tracing the reasons in virtue of which <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is justified in <span class="math">\(p\)</span> from which the emergent justification is enough to satisfy the requirements of some context <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some of the questions left open here are interesting in their own right and would warrant further work, what should be taken away from this discussion is the following: The infinitist can have a view in which justification emerges from a set of mutually supporting propositions of which there will be potentially infinitely many, and each of which the agent has had some doxastic attitude towards.</p>
<h3 id="principles-for-infinitism">Principles for Infinitism</h3>
<p>Klein argues that infinitism follows from two epistemic principles, the Principle of Avoiding Circularity (PAC) and the Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(PAC): For all propositions, <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is warranted for a person, <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, at <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, then for all <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is in the reason-ancestry of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> for <span class="math">\(S\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is not in the reason-ancestry of <span class="math">\(y\)</span> for <span class="math">\(S\)</span> at t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(PAC) asserts that for any proposition which a person has reason for believing, the proposition which the person has reasons for, should not be in the reason-ancestry of itself. The motivation for accepting this principle is the same motivation behind fallaciously reasoning via begging the question. While Klein spends about as much time covering linear-coherence theories as others have given to infinitist theories <span class="citation">(Peter D Klein 1999, 298)</span><span class="citation">(P. Klein and Ginet 2014, 2506)</span>, those that agree about the wrongness of circular reasoning should be able to accept (PAC).</p>
<p>However, there are good reasons (and hopefully infinitely many) for accepting (PAC). Because we are looking to answer (RP), the relevant question is: How could circularity ever raise the rational credence of a questioned proposition? Specifically, notice that transfer-coherence theories are going to allow a reasoner to be able to set the rational credence of any given proposition and its negation both to <span class="math">\(1.0\)</span>, where the possible values are between <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Consider: If you can admit a proposition, say <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, into the reason ancestry for itself, then the credence for <span class="math">\(p\)</span> will be <span class="math">\(1.0\)</span> because trivially <span class="math">\(p \to p\)</span>. But you can also reason about <span class="math">\(\lnot p\)</span>, and admit <span class="math">\(\lnot p\)</span> into the reason ancestry for itself. A reasoner will always be able to generate a credence of <span class="math">\(1.0\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\lnot p\)</span>, which does not at all raise rational credence. This contradiction is fatal to transfer-coherence theories.</p>
<p>The second principle required is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(PAA) For all propositions, <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is warranted for a person, <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, at <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, then there is some reason, <span class="math">\(r_1\)</span>, available to <span class="math">\(S\)</span> for <span class="math">\(x\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t\)</span>; and there is some reason, <span class="math">\(r_2\)</span> available to <span class="math">\(S\)</span> for <span class="math">\(r_1\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t_1\)</span> etc., and there is no last reason in the series.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two important notions in this principle: <em>availability</em> and <em>reasons</em>. The crucial point about availability for formulating infinitism is that for a proposition to be available, it need not be occurently believed. Availability is best described by the example given in Klein, where &quot;<span class="math">\(352 + 226 = 578\)</span>&quot; is available to all with the appropriate algebraic notions, but may never be instantiated. Furthermore, the belief will have infinitely many possible justifying reasons, where, for instance, &quot;<span class="math">\(352 + 227 \neq 578\)</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class="math">\(352 + 228 \neq 578\)</span>&quot;, etc, all of which may or may not ever be instantiated.</p>
<p>The conception of reasons can remain open-ended to formulate infinitism. There need only be a correct account, and the reader is free to accept their favorite account. Some examples include probabilistic reasoning, social conceptions, a virtue account, or process reliablism. This is where many misconceptions of infinitism arise. Infinitism <em>does not</em> hold that any cited chain is infinite, which is the motivation behind the finite mind objection. Infinitism <em>does</em> hold that no reason can escape further questioning, which is why self-justifying or meta-justifying foundationalism will fail.</p>
<h3 id="the-interrogation-argument">The Interrogation Argument</h3>
<p>Klein argues that neither foundationalism nor coherentism, the former necessarily justification-transfer and the latter either justification-transfer or justification-emergent, can solve (RP). He shows this by means of a conversation between two agents, representing the viewpoints of a foundationalist, coherentist, and a doubter. The Interrogation Argument concerns doxastic justification, as it actually instantiates the propositions as beliefs. Furthermore, the Interrogation Argument is about the <em>practice</em> of the solutions to (RP). As such, it does not argue that foundationalism or coherentism are wrong, but rather, that a self-conscious practitioner will not be able non-arbitrarily or consistently use those theories to raise their level of justification for a believed proposition. It is really important to note that Klein in <em>not</em> arguing that any of these theories are incorrect, but rather that neither foundationalism nor coherentism can provide a solution to (RP) <em>because</em> they cannot be &quot;employed by a self-conscious practitioner to increase the rational credibility of a questioned proposition.&quot; Let this be expressed by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(USP) An account of justification should be useable by a self-conscious practitioner to increase the credibility of questioned propositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To represent the doubter, Klein uses the name Doris. In the conversation regarding foundationalism, the other participant's name is Fred. Fred asserts that <span class="math">\((p)\)</span>. Doris asks Fred for his reason for believing <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, to which Fred responds <span class="math">\((r_1)\)</span>. The next natural question that Doris poses is what are Fred's reasons for <span class="math">\((r_1)\)</span>? The response is <span class="math">\((r_2)\)</span>, and this back and forth goes on for some time. Finally, Fred comes to <span class="math">\((b)\)</span>, which is a foundational belief. Fred asserts that it is no longer appropriate to ask of <span class="math">\((b)\)</span> the question asked of <span class="math">\((r_1) \dots (r_n)\)</span>. Doris's next question is much different, asking of Fred, &quot;I grant that <span class="math">\((b)\)</span> has autonomous justification. But what I want to know is whether autonomously justified propositions are, in virtue of that fact, somewhat likely to be true.&quot;</p>
<p>There are only three possible doxastic attitude with regards to a proposition: assent, dissent, or withholding judgement. Fred has these three options with regards to Doris's question about the relationship between autonomous warrant and truth. Fred's options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>He can hold that autonomously justified propositions are somewhat likely to be true in virtue of the fact that they are autonomously justified.</li>
<li>He can deny that autonomously justified propositions are somewhat likely to be true in virtue of the fact that they are autonomously justified.</li>
<li>He can withhold whether autonomously justified propositions are somewhat likely to be true in virtue of the fact that they are autonomously justified.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is now clear: Fred has a trilemma where none of options are tenable. If Fred holds that autonomously justified propositions are likely to be true in light of autonomous justification, then, Klein argues, &quot;the regress has continued.&quot; Fred has to produce his reasons for thinking that any proposition, in this case <span class="math">\((b)\)</span>, with the property of autonomous justification, <span class="math">\((F)\)</span>, is likely to be true, and this continues <em>ad infinitum</em>. If Fred sees this and either denies or withholds judgment, then his belief set and their justification relationships are somehow &quot;not likely to be true.&quot; This would solve the regress but transfer no warrant. This is a general recipe for showing that any candidate for being a foundational property will fail to transfer justification.</p>
<p>Klein crafts a similar argument against coherentism, where instead of Fred the foundationalist, there is Carl the coherentist. Carl faces a trilemma like Fred's, where Doris questions Carl about whether a coherent set of propositions is likely to be true. If Carl denies or withholds, then why should we adopt coherent sets of beliefs over incoherent sets? If Carl holds that a coherent set of propositions makes them likely to be true, then the regress continues. Thus, Klein concludes, coherentism cannot be the solution to the regress problem, as a coherentist cannot increase credibility of propositions.</p>
<p>Thus, because the only two logical possibilities besides infinitism are inconsistent or arbitrary in practice, we have reason to believe that infinitism is the solution to (RP). Although this assumes justifiedness is even possible, that the regress does not lead to skepticism, the scope of that project is too great to do justice in a piece on infinitism. The responses that Klein gives to the best objections to skepticism offer some positive reasons for accepting infinitism. This is the eliminative argument for infinitism.</p>
<p>The views competing to solve (RP) must make one of two moves: (1) give an answer to the trilemma that does not suffer from the problems of inconsistency or arbitrariness, but this does not appear hopeful; or (2) to account for what has gone wrong in the set up or execution of such a conversation. Both Ginet and Bergmann take the second approach.</p>
<h2 id="existing-objections-to-infinitism">Existing Objections to Infinitism</h2>
<p>This work will consider two objections to infinitism, from Ginet and Bergmann.</p>
<h3 id="ginets-reply-to-klein">Ginet's &quot;Reply to Klein&quot;</h3>
<p>The format of the book is such that first, Klein answers &quot;yes&quot; to the question of whether infinitism is the solution to (RP). Second, Ginet answers &quot;no&quot; to the question of whether infinitism is the solution to (RP). Third, Klein is given an opportunity to retort. Finally, Ginet is given the last word, responding to Klein's retort. This section will outline that last retort. The section of Ginet's reply which is relevant is the first, titled &quot;Fred and Doris.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="interpreting-ginets-response">Interpreting Ginet's response</h4>
<p>Let the questioned proposition that Fred and Doris are trying to raise the rational credence for be the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\((1)\)</span> Little Benny has been in the living room with blue paint on his hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doris asks Fred why he thinks this is so, and Fred dutifully answers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\((2)\)</span> There is a blue smear on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predictably, Doris ask for Fred's reason, to which Fred responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\((p)\)</span> I see a blue smear on a white surface right in front of me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ginet says that Fred has run out of reasons he could infer <span class="math">\((p)\)</span> from, but being both an epistemologist and a parent, Fred can entertain Doris' predictable questions. He says that Fred &quot;has no reason for thinking that [he] see[s] a blue smear on a white surface&quot; in the sense which there is a premise and conclusion, but it is &quot;eminently reasonable&quot; because of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> My visual experience is as if I see such a thing and I am aware of no reason to think that my visual experience might in this case be misleading me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking a bit from her usual style, Ginet's Doris points out that <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> commits Fred to the following two conjuncts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\((r_1)\)</span> When <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, it is <em>likely to be true</em> that I see a blue smear on a white surface.</p>
<p><span class="math">\((r_2)\)</span> <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> does obtain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Doris further asks whether it is only because these beliefs are available to him as reasons for believing <span class="math">\(p\)</span> that he is justified in believing <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Fred sees what is coming, the hard trilemma of the Interrogation Argument, and so retreats somewhat on <span class="math">\(r_{1}\)</span> to a weaker first half of the conjunct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span> When <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, it is <em>reasonable for me</em> to believe that (<span class="math">\(p\)</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ginet notes that he is not persuaded that this reason for <span class="math">\(p\)</span> constitutes <em>Fred's actual reason</em> for believing it, but assumes for the sake of argument is &quot;at least part of&quot; Fred's justification.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Doris now asks for a reason to believe <span class="math">\((r_1 *) \land (r_2)\)</span>, and Ginet would have Fred answer that: First, of <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need no premise from which to infer <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>. This is because <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span> is a basic <em>a priori</em> principle constitutive of the concept of justification for belief in a particular proposition like (<span class="math">\(p\)</span>): it is a principle that understanding it requires accepting it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, of <span class="math">\((r_2)\)</span>, &quot;Nor do I need a premise from which to infer <span class="math">\((r_2\)</span>).&quot; This is because the following is a &quot;basic <em>a priori</em> principle constitutive of the concept of justification for conscious-state propositions like <span class="math">\((r_2)\)</span>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\((r_{3})\)</span>: When <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, and one is prompted by that fact to believe that <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, then that belief is justified.</p>

<p>This is quite hard to follow, but what I take Ginet to be saying is this, where &quot;<span class="math">\(\rightharpoondown\)</span>&quot; is &quot;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> is the basic <em>a priori</em> principle from which <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is derived&quot;, &quot;<span class="math">\(\to\)</span>&quot; is &quot;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> justifies for Fred that <span class="math">\(y\)</span>&quot;, and &quot;<span class="math">\(\rightharpoonup\)</span>&quot; is &quot;<span class="math">\(x\)</span> makes eminently reasonable that <span class="math">\(y\)</span>&quot;: <span class="math">\[(((r_{3}) \rightharpoondown (r_2)) \land (r_1 *)) \to (\mathrm{C}) \rightharpoonup (p) \to (2) \to (1)\]</span></p>
<p>Which translates to: &quot;When <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, and one is prompted by that fact to believe that <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, then that belief is justified.&quot; is the <em>a priori</em> principle from which Fred's belief about propositions like &quot;<span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> does obtain.&quot; follows from, which along with his belief that &quot;When <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, it is reasonable for me to believe that (<span class="math">\(p\)</span>).&quot; justifies that &quot;My visual experience is as if I see such a thing and I am aware of no reason to think that my visual experience might in this case be misleading me.&quot; which makes eminently clear that (<span class="math">\(p\)</span>) which justifies that (2) which justifies that (1).</p>
<h4 id="criticizing-ginets-response">Criticizing Ginet's response</h4>
<p>This response to Klein's Interrogation Argument is not successful because it is hinged on a principle that either continues the regress if true or solves nothing if false. I think there are more reasons to believe that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> is false than there are reasons to believe it continues the regress, but this work will cover both. First, the argument <em>against</em> <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> will comprise of a straightforward counterexample to the principle coming from Collier, giving reason to doubt it. Second, my argument assuming that <span class="math">\(r_3\)</span> is true will show that the regress continues, and use a conclusion from the argument against <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> to undermine a move Ginet might make in response.</p>
<h5 id="first-the-case-that-r_3-is-false">First, the case that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> is false</h5>
<p>Ginet asserts that &quot;When <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains and one is prompted by that fact to believe <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, then that belief is justified.&quot; This is the causal theory of knowledge from the perspective of justification. Where Ginet writes &quot;prompted,&quot; I read it to be is synonymous with &quot;caused.&quot; Revising <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> to reflect this, the condition on justification that we are considering is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(CJ) If <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains and <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is caused by that fact to believe <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, then that belief is justified for <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of the discussion between Doris and Fred, (CJ) requires that Fred's belief that there is a blue smear on a white surface be caused, in some sense, by the state of affairs described by &quot;the blue smear on the white surface.&quot; This is a straightforward instance of Alvin Goldman's causal theory of knowledge from the perspective of justification. But this is a bad requirement on justification, because there is a counterexample to the causal theory of knowing found in Kenneth Collier's &quot;Contra the Causal Theory of Knowing.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is the counterexample applied to Fred. Ginet requires (CJ), that for a belief to be justified, it must be somehow caused by the state of affairs described by the contents of that belief. Say that Doris, unbeknownst to Fred, administers to him a hallucinogenic drug, and one of the effects of the drug is that he believes that his hallucinations are actually not hallucinations, but real. One of the hallucinations this drug induces is that Doris gave the drug to Fred, and that he believes this hallucination to be real. Collier gives Ginet a dilemma, he must hold either that (1) Fred knows Doris gave him the drug, or that (2) Fred does not know Doris gave him the drug, that the causal connection is somehow broken <span class="citation">(Collier 1973)</span>.</p>
<p>If the causal theorist says that (1), Fred does know that Doris gave him the drug, then they need explain how this particular hallucination is different from other hallucinations, and it does not seem relevantly different. Perhaps, Collier wonders, what is different is that other more normal hallucinations are not true. But this is not promising because if the drug causes in Fred the belief that there is a blue smear on a white surface in front of him and <em>there is</em> a blue smear on a white surface in front of him, the intuition is that he still does not know.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The causal theorist objects to this that there is no causal connection when Fred hallucinates about the blue smear. Even so, it could be posited that there is a causal connection and there still be no knowledge, because Fred could have been told in advance or had some sort of suspicion. That would mean his justification that there is a blue smear in front of him, that is <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, was caused <em>by the fact that</em> <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, and still the intuition should be this hallucination is not knowledge. If the causal theorist says that (2) Fred does not know, then there needs to be an account of proper causation not found in Ginet, but perhaps exists.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps you do not accept this argument, or maybe you think that there are good candidates which are not <em>ad hoc</em> to defend against Colliers' counterexample. It will not save Ginet's reply, however, because the only conclusion my overall argument <em>needs</em> to draw from this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(RD) One can understand <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> and have reason to doubt it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next section, I will use this as a premise against a complaint Ginet will raise of my second argument.</p>
<h5 id="second-assuming-r_3-is-true-it-fixes-nothing">Second, assuming <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> is true, it fixes nothing</h5>
<p>(RP) is looking for the series of reasons which can raise the rational credence of a proposition. Klein's interrogation argument operates under (USP), and that means we can ask whether certain propositions would raise the rational credence for any agent, namely Fred. On this note, I believe that relations like &quot;<span class="math">\(p\)</span> follows from the basic a priori principle <span class="math">\(q\)</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="math">\(p\)</span> makes <span class="math">\(q\)</span> eminently clear&quot; are one which raise rational credence. Additionally, I will show that not only does the regress continue, but that Doris now has two questions she can raise instead of one.</p>
<p>First, when Doris asks Fred why he believes that <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>, <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> is a great reason to believe <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>, as it is the general form. Furthermore, Doris is granting that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> is true. Now, one question that Doris can ask of Fred is, why does Fred believe that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span>? That is, why believe that &quot;[w]hen <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, and one is prompted by that fact to believe that <span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> obtains, that belief is justified?&quot; While Ginet says that Fred does not need it &quot;as a premise from which to infer <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>&quot;, it has to be true that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> raises the rational credence of <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>. This is reasonable because if a rational agent knew it was true that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span>, that is the general case, it would be true that <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>, which is the specific instantiation of <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> for blue smears on white surfaces. There must be a reason for <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> to be true. This reason, say <span class="math">\((r_4)\)</span>, would raise the rational credence for a self-conscious agent in the questioned proposition. The regress has continued.</p>
<p>To this, Ginet will complain that he posited that to understand <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span> requires accepting it, and that perhaps Doris is not understanding it. Understanding <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span> does not require accepting it, because (RD). What I concluded from my discussion about the reasons to think that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> is false is that, at very least, there is reason to doubt <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span>, and because it is the general form of propositions like <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span>, there is reason to doubt <span class="math">\((r_1 *)\)</span> as well.</p>
<p>Second, and much more straightforwardly, I see no defense in Ginet from Doris merely asking, &quot;Why believe that <span class="math">\((r_2)\)</span>?&quot; That is, &quot;Why believe that '<span class="math">\((\mathrm{C})\)</span> does obtain.'?&quot; Ginet says &quot;It is clear that <span class="math">\((r_3)\)</span> could not serve as a premise in an inference justifying belief in <span class="math">\((r_2)\)</span>.&quot; Thus, Doris keeps doubting.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>While a formidable elucidation of the disagreement between infinitists and foundationalists, Ginet's response does not successfully answer (RP) as it has been formulated here. If <span class="math">\((r_{3})\)</span> is true, then the regress continues in more ways than one, and if <span class="math">\((r_{3})\)</span> is false, then the response strait-forwardly fails.</p>
<h3 id="bergmanns-is-klein-an-infinitist-about-doxastic-justification">Bergmann's &quot;Is Klein an infinitist about doxastic justification?&quot;</h3>
<p>Michael Bergmann, in his paper &quot;Is Klein an infinitist about doxastic justification?&quot; makes three points about infinitism found in Klein's &quot;Human Knowledge and the Infinite Progress of Reasoning.&quot; First, he thinks that Klein does not have an infinitist solution to (RP). Second, he poses a dilemma for Klein where he thinks neither horn is acceptable. Third, he holds that Klein's objection to foundationalism fails. I will interpret and respond to all three points.</p>
<h4 id="kleins-solution-is-not-infinitist">Klein's solution is not infinitist</h4>
<p>Bergmann's account of (RP) is subtly different from the way that (RP) has been unpacked here, and when we see his formulation it will become clear how Klein's solution is an infinitist one. Here is Bergmann's reductio version of (RP):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Assume for reductio: A belief of ours can be justified only if it is inferentially justified.</li>
<li>A belief of ours can be inferentially justified only if the belief from which it is inferred is a justified belief.</li>
<li>From (1) and (2): Therefore, either our beliefs can be justified via circular reasoning or they can be justified via infinite chains of reasoning or it is not possible for our beliefs to be justified,</li>
<li>Our beliefs can not be justified via circular reasoning.</li>
<li>Our beliefs can not be justified via infinite chains of reasoning.</li>
<li>It is possible for our beliefs to be justified.</li>
<li>From (4), (5), and (6): Therefore, (3) is false.</li>
<li>From (3) and (7): 3 is both true and false.</li>
<li>By reductio, from (1) to (8): Therefore, (1) is false.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bergmann claims there are only four ways to reject foundationalism, as the argument is valid and has four premises. Those four ways are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Unjustified Foundations</em>: Our beliefs can be inferentially justified even if the beliefs from which they are inferred are unjustified (so premise 2 is false)</p>
<p><em>Linear coherentism</em>: Our beliefs can be justified via circular reasoning (so premise 4 is false).</p>
<p><em>Infinitism</em>: Our beliefs can be justified via an infinite chain of reasoning (so premise 5 is false)</p>
<p><em>Radical Skepticism</em>: It is impossible for our beliefs to be justified (so premise 6 is false)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that while it is true that there are four premises on the table for rejecting, does it also mean that there are only four ways of rejecting these premises? There is no reason that one should not be able to reject 2 or more premises. It is in this way that Bergmann's (RP) is different from how it has been formulated here.</p>
<h4 id="a-dilemma-for-klein">A dilemma for Klein</h4>
<p>In order to pin down Klein's account as non-infinitist, Bergmann begins putting pressure on some of Klein's claim about doxastic justification. Bergmann takes Klein's account of doxastic justification to be <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is doxastically justified in believing <span class="math">\(p\)</span> if and only if &quot;<span class="math">\(S\)</span> has engaged in tracing the reasons in virtue of which the proposition <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is justified far enough forward to satisfy the contextually determined requirements.&quot; For example, take context <span class="math">\(C\)</span> where a <span class="math">\(S\)</span> holds <span class="math">\(B_1\)</span>, and this is based on some prior <span class="math">\(B_2\)</span>, and so on until some contextually determined end <span class="math">\(B_x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The way that Bergmann interprets this is that Klein thinks that <span class="math">\(B_1\)</span> is <em>based on</em> <span class="math">\(B_2\)</span>. He expresses this with the following principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(K1) For a belief <span class="math">\(B\)</span> to be doxastically justified, it must be based on some other belief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because for any <span class="math">\(B_x\)</span>, there is going to be no doxastic prior, (K1) claims that the belief will not be justified. But Bergmann thinks it is even more worrying when combined with the doxastic version of the (K1):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(K2) A belief can be doxastically justified by being based on some other belief only if that other belief is itself doxastically justified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This results in none of the chains of doxastically held beliefs being justified. Klein must either accept or reject (K2). Rejecting (K2) commits Klein to the view that &quot;a belief can be justified even if the reason one has for it is an unjustified belief&quot; <span class="citation">(Bergmann 2007, 23)</span>. Accepting (K2) commits Klein to an agent holding infinitely many beliefs to be justified, which is absurd.</p>
<h4 id="kleins-rejects-k2-and-premise-5">Klein's rejects (K2) and premise (5)</h4>
<p>Bergmann seems to think that Klein must claim that either (1) our beliefs can be inferentially justified only if the belief from which it is inferred are not justified <em>or</em> (2) our beliefs can not be justified via an infinite chain of reasoning, but, strangely, that he cannot reject both. What has gone wrong here is that Bergmann is thinking that Klein holds that justification is <em>transferred</em> from epistemically prior reasons, where Klein actually thinks that doxastic justification is an emergent property of a set of believed propositions. Bergmann acknowledges this view in a footnote, but ascribes it to holistic coherentists solely.</p>
<p>Recall from the interpretation of the infinitist position what Klein had to say about the source of justification,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infinitism is like the warrant-emergent form of coherentism because it holds that [justification] for a questioned proposition emerges as the proposition becomes embedded in a set of propositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This takes the disagreement between Klein and Bergmann all the way back to the assumption that Bergmann made for his reductio, that &quot;A belief of ours can be justified only if it is inferentially justified.&quot; The ambiguity of the word &quot;belief&quot; causes some confusion, where what infinitism shares with foundationalism is that propositions can be prior and latter to one another but an actual belief is justified when its propositional content becomes embedded in a set of propositions. Klein will agree with this assumption about <em>propositional</em> justification and only insofar as propositions are are epistemically prior or epistemically posterior to one another.</p>
<p>Bergmann is concerned about doxastic justification, however. Consider premise (2), that &quot;a belief of ours can be inferentially justified only if the belief from which it is inferred is a justified belief.&quot; This is how Bergmann pins the Unjustified Foundations view on Klein, by showing that he must reject (K2) (because the alternative leads to infinitely many doxastic beliefs for justification) and not Premise (5). First, I will show that and how Klein rejects (K2). Then, I'll show this is consistent with rejecting Premise (5).</p>
<h5 id="klein-rejects-k2">Klein rejects (K2)</h5>
<p>The account of doxastic justification attributed to Klein in &quot;Is Klein an infinitist about doxastic justification?&quot; would commit him to Bergmann's problematic dilemma if only one premise can be rejected. What has gone wrong is that Bergmann has wrongly interpreted Klein's account of propositional justification from his account of doxastic justification. As we noted in the interpretation of infinitism, what Klein holds that infinitism shares with foundationalism is that some beliefs and their propositions are epistemically prior to others. This is what Bergmann is picking up from his reading. However, what infinitism shares with the defensible varieties of coherentism is that a questioned belief becomes increasingly justified by being embedded in a <em>set</em> of propositions or beliefs. It is this that Bergmann gets wrong about infinitism.</p>
<p>Klein would hold that for <span class="math">\(S\)</span>'s questioned belief <span class="math">\(B_1\)</span> to be doxastically justified the belief must be embedded in a set of beliefs, of which there are now two. For it to be propositionally justified, it must have an epistemic prior. For it to be doxastically justified, the context somehow determines how many beliefs have to be in the set for there to be sufficient justification. Thus, Klein rejects (K2) in favor of a justification-emergent view of doxastic justification.</p>
<h5 id="rejecting-k2-is-consistent-with-rejecting-premise-5">Rejecting (K2) is consistent with rejecting Premise (5)</h5>
<p>Concerning some subject <span class="math">\(S\)</span> in context <span class="math">\(C\)</span> believing <span class="math">\(B_1\)</span> through <span class="math">\(B_x\)</span>, Klein shares with the foundationalists that there are epistemically prior propositions, his thesis is that there are <em>potentially</em> infinitely many and that the level of justification will be related to how many reasons <span class="math">\(S\)</span> <em>actually</em> has.</p>
<h4 id="bergmanns-defense-of-foundationalism">Bergmann's defense of foundationalism</h4>
<h5 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h5>
<p>The way that Bergmann interprets the Interrogation Argument is as being hinged on the following claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(K3) If Fred sees what is coming and refrains from making any of those three responses, then he is holding unexamined beliefs and is not an epistemically responsible agent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bergmann has a dilemma for the defender of (K3), either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>&quot;[T]he allegedly require examination could be satisfied by basing <span class="math">\(B\)</span> on an <em>un</em>justified belief&quot;; or</li>
<li>&quot;[T]he allegedly required examination takes (K2) for granted.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason that Bergmann rejects (1) is because he rightly rejects Unjustified Foundations. The reason Bergmann rejects (2) is because it leads to global skepticism.</p>
<h5 id="criticism">Criticism</h5>
<p>The second horn of the dilemma only leads to skepticism on a justification-transfer view.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The fundamental mistake that Bergmann makes in his objections to Klein's take on doxastic justification is applying his own justification-transfer view too hastily to Klein, who formulates infinitism as has a justification-emergent view. The secondary mistake that Bergmann makes in his formulation of (RP) is that to give a response to it, one must reject one or another premise but not both. A justification-emergent view allows the infinitist to reject both Premise (2) and Premise (5) consistently.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-objection-for-infinitism">A New Objection for Infinitism</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>The primary motivation behind infinitism's cavalier rejection is that it is intuitively discordant with &quot;how we actually could reason&quot; on first gloss. For instance, the finite mind objection<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> is motivated strongly by common sense: we cannot believe infinitely many things, how could infinitism solve the regress problem when <em>it is the regress</em>? What I read in this is that the pre-theoretical sentiment that some who raise this objection are expressing is that they want to find out &quot;how we actually reason&quot; and have this inform a response to (RP). Ginet, in an aside, notes that he does not think that any claims about the theory of justification are Fred's &quot;actual reasons&quot; for believing perceptual claims. Perhaps Ginet's pre-theoretical incentive to seek a foundational theory is of the form: (1) we do come to be justified, that is we are not skeptics, (2) we <em>actually</em> infer everything from basic propositions, (3) inferring from basic propositions must lend us justification. This is a different approach from what is found in the Interrogation Argument, namely that the correct view is going to be the one which can be practiced consistently.</p>
<p>Additionally, I read Bergmann's article as pressuring a similar point insofar as he wants to avoid &quot;going meta&quot; by blurring the line between agent and epistemologist. Specifically, Bergmann objects to (K3), the &quot;examination requirement.&quot; Recall from the interpretation of Klein</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(USP) An account of justification should be useable by a self-conscious practitioner to increase the credibility of questioned propositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am going to put pressure on this principle in a way that does not suffer from the same problems and assumptions in Bergmann's argument. I think the meta-epistemological issues that Klein, Ginet, and Bergmann might disagree on are whether or not we should try to build our theory on &quot;how people actually reason and are successful at it&quot; or &quot;what the epistemologist can successfully defend.&quot; Which of these approaches is better? To explore this topic, I will object to infinitism on two fronts: (1) with regards to &quot;meta&quot; beliefs justifying everyday beliefs, and (2) by distinguishing requirements on agents and on theorists.</p>
<h3 id="meta-level-justifiers">Meta-level justifiers</h3>
<p>Consider the following two propositions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(PB) There is a blue smear on the wall.</p>
<p>(FT) Foundationalism is the correct solution to the regress problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Interrogation Argument, a critical point in its favor is that when Fred is tracing his reasons to believe his questioned proposition, he is the one that is required to &quot;go meta&quot; first. That is, Fred is the one who will jump from propositions about walls, tables, and chairs to propositions about epistemology. When he gets to his foundational belief, he asserts to Doris that it is his foundational belief and that he need no further reason. Doris correspondingly &quot;goes meta&quot;, and asks about the truth-conduciveness of foundational beliefs. There is such a disconnect between (PB) and (FT), however, in the sense that when one removes oneself from that critical point in the conversation it is difficult to see how (FT) could raise the rational credence of (PB).</p>
<p>Do claims about epistemology ever raise the rational justification in beliefs about walls, tables, and chairs? If they can, epistemologists who have reasoned from everyday beliefs to their theory have higher amounts of justification in beliefs about walls, tables, and chairs than the average, everyday believer. I take this to be a bad result, as my intuition is that a journalist sitting at her computer is as justified in believing her computer is in front of her as an epistemologist is when she is sitting in front of her computer. If they cannot, then we should reject (USP).</p>
<h3 id="distinguishing-theorists-and-agents">Distinguishing theorists and agents</h3>
<p>Imagine that an epistemologist is interested, as they are, in giving an account of knowledge. Having reviewed the arguments, the epistemologist comes to accept the theory that &quot;justified true belief is necessary on knowledge.&quot; Thus, any other epistemologist must account for the justified true belief theory in further theorizing. However, an agent need not <em>realize</em> that justified true belief is necessary on knowledge to come to know something. That is, an account of knowledge does not need to be usable by self-conscious practitioner to increase the likelihood of that practitioner's knowing some proposition. The (JTB) account of knowledge need not be employable by an agent for that agent to know <span class="math">\((p)\)</span>, but the (JTB) theorist needs it to determine whether an agent knows <span class="math">\((p)\)</span>. Why think that in order for the (JTB) theory to provide an answer to the question of &quot;What is knowledge?&quot; it needs to employable by a self-conscious practitioner for anything at all?</p>
<p>With regards to justification, the dissenter of Klein's Interrogation Argument could claim the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Meta-justificatory feature <span class="math">\((F)\)</span> is necessary for justification.</li>
<li>A justification theorist must account for <span class="math">\((F)\)</span>.</li>
<li>A justification agent need not realize that <span class="math">\((F)\)</span> is a feature of justification to be justified.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The move a foundationalist could make with this is: Meta-justification foundationalism need not be employable by an agent for that agent to be justified, rather, the justification theorist needs it to determine whether an agent is justified. That is, why think that in order for the foundationalist's theory of justification to provide an answer to the question of &quot;What is the solution to the regress problem?&quot; it need be able to be used employed by a self-conscious practitioner to raise credence? This would neutralize the interrogation objection because Fred would need only get to the belief with <span class="math">\((F)\)</span> to be justified. Instead of answering Klein's trilemma, the foundationalist can complain that what has gone wrong with the Interrogation Argument is that Fred's attempting to practice the theory. Until there's a convincing argument for (USP), if Fred satisfies the conditions, then Fred can simply remain silently justified.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>What I take this to show is that there are at least two points worth contending about the set up of the Interrogation Argument. The way these points fit into the discussion is that, if they are sound, then the Interrogation Argument can be called into question under them, and any response I gave to Ginet or Bergmann will fail to be important. I advocate &quot;biting the bullet&quot; on the intuition about the journalist and the epistemologist dilemma in the following way: If the epistemologist has reasoned extensively about the computer in front of her and has more explicit justifications for its being there, then perhaps the correct response is that she <em>is</em> more justified than her journalist analogue. Furthermore, Klein, in personal correspondence, &quot;doubles down&quot; on the argument against (USP) from the agent/theorist distinction convincingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Suppose the person claims that all justification is based on foundational beliefs, but whenever they give a purported example of such a belief, it turns out not to be a basic belief. Shouldn't they give up on the theory?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My worry about this is that Klein may have not found the solution to the regress problem, but rather, found a way that infinitism can be used by a self-conscious practitioner, which might be more limited.</p>
<p>The theoretical cost of the Interrogation Argument to the foundationalist and coherentist should still be worrisome. If a physicist had a theory about spaceflight that worked well until it was put into practice, it would quickly be disregarded.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this paper I have: (1) interpreted infinitism and the argument for it as it is found in Klein's &quot;Infinitism is the Solution to the Regress Problem&quot; and &quot;Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons&quot;; (2) defended that argument from objections in Ginet's &quot;Reply to Klein&quot; and Bergmann's &quot;Is Klein an infinitist about doxastic justification?&quot;; and (3) diagnosed the meta-epistemological disagreements this dialogue may have arisen from.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

See: Radford (1966) for rejecting the belief condition, Kornblith (2008) for rejecting the justification condition, or Hazlett (2010) for rejecting the truth condition.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This is a very interesting aside found in Ginet, and I ask that the reader remember this for when I consider a new problem for infinitism. I think what motivated Ginet in this comment is the same motivation behind one of Bergmann's objections.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>The causal theorist is welcome to disagree here, as intuitions do vary, but I must admit I think this comes at great cost.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Some suggestions that motivate (2) from Goldman's 1976 &quot;Discrimination and Perceptual Knowledge&quot; are that perhaps Fred needs to <em>rule out relevant alternative</em> or be able to <em>perceptually discriminate</em> between a hallucination and not in order to know. These are good candidates, but there discussion is not suitable here.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn7"><p>If there is any good here, it is because of the skill and insight of those who taught me epistemology; I thank Professor Klein, Professor Goldman, and Dr. Sylvan. If there is any bad here, I will have to work harder to reflect the quality of my education.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>
