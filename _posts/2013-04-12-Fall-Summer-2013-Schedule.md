title: Summer and Fall Semester 2013 
---

In an unusual change of pace for Rutgers, I was not bombarded by a slew
of reminders and warnings about how the deadline for signing up
for classes was coming up. I learnt from a friend that some people
had signed up for classes already.

So frantically, I log on to WebReg, the thought of everything being
closed is racing through my mind.

I was fine, with just under a hundred credits, there was nothing closed.

### Summer

I love summer classes. They're smaller, it's nice outside, and this
summer I'll have a house with my best friends on campus.
Here are my thoughts on those two classes:

#### Internet Technology (01:198:352) <small>with J. Francisco</small>

This course is on IP protocols, media access protocols, socket programming, multicasting, 
multimedia over the Internet, switching theory, and network architectures.

My understanding of the Internet is largely topical. 
I can hack my way around a server to get a page up, and I understand the meaning of all the words
in the description, but I would really like to formalize my understanding.

The last class I took on the web was Scripting for the World Wide Web at MCCC with Rob Fausey,
and it has proven the most enduringly useful course I have taken. 

#### Theory of Knowledge (01:730:220) <small>with [Kurt Sylvan](http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/people/graduate-students/682-sylvan-jurt)</small>

The class is on "the nature of belief, perception, certainty, justification and knowledge." 
I am excited for the class because I am really curious about the foundational issues of
epistemology. I feel forced to accept skepticism, and I find the arguments for it convincing,
but I take every opportunity to undermine my skepticism.

There are a few other really attractive classes being offered, namely (for me) Buddhist Philosophy,
but I chose Theory of Knowledge because I want my degree to take the angle of machine learning,
artificial intelligence, and viewing the brain as a complex machine.

### Fall

Here is my tentative schedule for Fall 2013. It's tentative because I am
really motivated to change one of my philosophy classes for Larry Tempkin's
seminar on ethics and switch a computer science course for Artificial Intelligence.

#### Systems Programming (01:198:214:02) <small>with [Brian Russel](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~morbius/)</small>

I've heard around from computer science students that "it's a crime if people graduate without" this class.
Of course, it is also with the magnanimous master pedant Morbius, so it's an obvious choice.
Ever since he showed me C, it's as though programming in Java is a crutch, because of, and these are his words,
the "mysterious stuff."

#### Principles of Programming Languages (01:198:314:02) <small>with [Louis Steinberg](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~lou/)</small>

The only programming languages I'm familiar with a functional, object oriented, and scripting languages.
I picked, and will certainly keep this course, because of the world of possibilities in knowing
other paradigms of programming.

#### Principles of Info & Data Management (01:198:336:01) <small>with [Tomasz Imielinski](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~imielins/)</small>

Data Structures proved to be, while difficult, an amazing formalization of theoretical computer science.
I picked this because I want that type of rigor with regards to databases.
I have heard that this is Professor Imielinski's magnum opus of a class, with very positive reviews from my peers.

#### Epistemology (01:730:412:01) <small>with [Peter Klein](http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/611-pklein)</small>

I am really pleased to be taking Theory of Knowledge before taking this class.
From the description and previous syllabi of this course, it is going to be an in-depth course,
and having a primer over the summer will be really worthwhile.
I am excited for this course for the same reason I am excited for Theory of Knowledge -
it directly adds value to what I want to learn and research, machine awareness and the brain as a machine.
Taking the course will do this because having a deeper understanding of epistemology will allow me to apply it,
and having a grounding will allow me to do more research on my own.

#### Philosophy Of Social Science (01:730:427:01) <small>with [Martin Bunzl](http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/588-martin-bunzl)</small>

I joined the tremendous Professor Mark Colby on a few of his lectures teaching this class,
and seeing the reading list inspired me to take the course.
