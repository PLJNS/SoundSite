### Hello, world!

And welcome to my blog. If you do not know me, allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Paul Jones. I was born on June 7th, 1993 in Birmingham, UK.
When I was four, my family moved to the country side surrounding Dijon, France,
where I spent the next four years of my life, and began my schooling.
In the year 2000, my family and I moved to the United States of America,
where I have resided ever since. I have become a citizen and
really love my adoptive country.

I graduated from Hamilton High School East in 2011, and earned
my Associate's Degree in Liberal Arts from Mercer County Community
College in 2012. Now, I am an undergraduate at Rutgers University, 
where I study Computer Science and Philosophy. I will graduate in 
the Spring of 2014.

I have worked as a Web Development Intern for Local Wisdom, Inc. in 
Princeton Junction, where I developed in Objective-C for iOS.

Now that you know a little about me, I want to outline where this
site came from and what I would like to do with it.

### Why did you do this?

I have been looking into making a blog for some time, 
and I have been on various platforms in the past.
There are a lot of really amazing, powerful tools out there
to help people express themselves. There are entire movements
behind Wordpress, Drupal, Tumblr, Jekyll.

I want my own web presence to be a full expression of me, one which I fully understand.
The blogs produced by other engines are *beautiful* and often quite easy,
but I felt very disingenuous producing a flashy blog using a large codebase
that I do not fully understand. What more, but then I could not easily
add my idiosyncrasies, like my love of Markdown, Bootstrap, typesetting, ...
So I wrote a little [Perl script](https://github.com/PLJNS/Markablog).
The engine, like the visual design, is very lightweight, and allows
me to focus exclusively on the content and on content creation
as an activity.

I made a platform like this because I recognize that having a public
platform to publish to makes me hold myself accountable to produce something.
I learnt this about myself after I wrote a hack to keep my notes on
university servers, which you can find [here](http://www.eden.rutgers.edu/~pmj34).
I also learnt from that project that there is a tremendous satisfaction
in working on the tools that you use to accomplish your own goals.
Every accomplishment (note entry, blog post, ...) adds value to your tool,
and every improvement to your tool betters your accomplishments.

Having outlined my motivation, I want to now make explicit what I want to share.

### What will you write about?

Here is a list of topics that I have thoughts I'd like to publish:

-   Computer science
    -   Projects
    -   Solutions, hacks, code
    -   My opinion on tech news

-   Philosophy
    -   Notes on reading outside of class
    -   Exposition of topics, my thoughts
    -   Interesting discussions from class

-   Media
    -   Music
        -   EDM releases
        -   Personal recordings
        -   And I will work through a EDM production book on the blog!
        
    -   Book reviews
    -   Movie reviews


-   Academics
    -   Class/professor reviews 
    -   Commentary/tips
    -   Experiences

### Well lets get started!

Thank you for reading and I hope you will come back soon!
