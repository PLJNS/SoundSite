New Jersey natives REZ and Progress have created a genre-bending and
groovy electro-hiphop track for their debut release on WILD JOKERS
RECORDS! After months of preparation from artist and label, REZ and
Progress are starting out on the right note. The groovy house with a
smooth bass line put out by REZ coupled with the compelling lyrics of
Progress will have you immediately feeling like one of “All Our People!”
This inventive track is the first of many collaborations to be released
by REZ and Progress and is a powerful debut release from these budding
artists.
