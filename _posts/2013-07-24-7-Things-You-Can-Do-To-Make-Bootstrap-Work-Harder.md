title: 7 Things You Can Do To Make Bootstrap Work Harder
---

<h3>Introduction</h3>
I love Bootstrap. Web development used to be this arduous and sometimes mysterious process to me, and this is pretty embarrassing for a computer science student. When I learned about Bootstrap and how you could add amazing components and get easy responsiveness with just a little markup, I began to dig into the source to figure out how it worked and how I could do more with it.

It has been quite a while since, and now I’ve used these amazing technologies like Node.js, the LESS CSS preprocessor, and jQuery. As strictly a pedantic exercise, Bootstrap has been and continues to be invaluable. To really learn how Bootstrap works, I developed what I named <a href="http://PLJNS.com/Rutstrap">Rutstrap</a>, a Rutgers Bootstrap theme.

But now that I’m coming to use these skills professionally, the question which digs deeply into my psyche: how can this make me better at what I do? That is, how can we speed up development time for website with this technology? And that’s not the only question Bootstrap has raised. Recently, I was asked at work whether a design was “Bootstrap compliant.” This was a request that at partner working with Local Wisdom made.

The immediate thought is that insofar as Bootstrap is a CSS framework, anything that can be done with CSS can be done with Bootstrap. But that was not what the partner was requesting from Local Wisdom. The answer to both the question about how Bootstrap can speed up development time and how a design can be “Bootstrap compliant” is …

Communication. Communication between architects and designers and programmers about what this technology actually is, what it makes easier, and what its limitations are. This document is intended for everyone in the web development process, and will seek to set out a formal, rigorous, and unambiguous definition of how we can speed up development with Bootstrap compliance.

<h3>1. Embrace the grid <small>Scaffolding</small></h3>

There are four targeted visibility classes in Bootstrap: high-definition, desktops, tables, and smartphones. A Bootstrap compliant design begins with a design resolution of 1,200 pixels in width. This is the minimum width for the desktop visibility class. Now add 30 pixels of white space to the left of your design, and we’re ready to add content to our future site.

Next, think about your content in rows and columns, where you can have any number of rows and up to 12 columns, any of which can be empty. The name for a column in Bootstrap-speak is a “span,” and it is enacted in code by a markup class like <code class='prettyprint'>span4</code>. The atomic size of a column is 70 pixels, which is a <code class='prettyprint'>span1</code>, and for every column size on top of this, add 100 times the size subtracted by one. For example, the size of a <code class='prettyprint'>span6</code> is (70 + 5 * 100) pixels, or 570 pixels. Every row has 30 pixels between itself and either side. Notice that for our 1,200 pixel wide design resolution, our columns will be a size with 70 pixels plus up to 1100 pixels. When we add our 30 pixel margin, we get back to our design size of 1,200.

<a href="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/grid.png"><img alt="grid" src="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/grid-400x118.png"  /></a>

The grid is capable of much more than this contrived base-case; you can even nest spans, but this math is done with percentages. This is the basic grid system that designers should think within if targeting Bootstrap. To speed up development further, use the out-of-the-box Bootstrap sizes. The hallmark of a Bootstrap compliant design is gridded content.

<h3>2. Use markup effectively <small>Base CSS</small></h3>
And now that we’re on content, now that we’re in the grid, you should know what tools both HTML5 has and Bootstrap extends to organize and markup your content. This is where you establish hierarchy.

For Bootstrap compliance, use any standard HTML5 elements like headers, paragraphs, emphasis, abbreviations, addresses, block quotes, lists, descriptions, code, tables, buttons, and images. But also know that you have Bootstrap extensions at your disposal.

For instance, you can specify paragraphs to be a lead, which gives the paragraph prominence in the hierarchy.

<a href="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lead.png"><img alt="lead" src="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/lead-400x125.png"  /></a>

Bootstrap also makes it easy to align text with the classes <code class='prettyprint'>text-left</code>, <code class='prettyprint'>text-center</code>, and <code class='prettyprint'>text-right</code>. But sometimes what you want your content to express just isn’t possible with sizing or alignment, and Bootstrap provides the following emphasis classes for content to make this possible with <i>color</i>:
<ul>
	<li><b style="color: #999999;">muted</b>, a subtle gray when it’s not <i>too</i> important;</li>
	<li><b style="color: #c09853;">warning</b>, an almost alarming orange for when nothing is wrong, but it could soon be;</li>
	<li><b style="color: #b94a48;">error</b>, a shocking red for when something is wrong;</li>
	<li><b style="color: #3a87ad;">info</b>, a cool blue for cool facts; and</li>
	<li><b style="color: #468847;">success</b>, and a reassuring green for rewarding users.</li>
</ul>
You can add the same colors to your table rows for the same effects as on text. You can add the same colors to your button and form markup for the same effects. You can add them to the alerts, covered further down. These classes and colors are central to conveying meaning in Bootstrap, and making use of them is key to speeding up development with Bootstrap compliance. Designers and architects should tell developers what elements are muted, warnings, errors, etc, so that the markup can match the meaning and the meaning can be easily conveyed with Bootstrap.

For the content that can’t be expressed by the characters on the keyboard, Bootstrap provides <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/base-css.html#icons">icons from Glyphicons</a>. For those looking for something a little more scalable, Glyphicons has an older brother, <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>.

You can find more information about Bootstrap markup <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/base-css.html">on their site</a>.
<h3>3. Wireframe with meaning <small>Components</small></h3>
Now that our base content is gridded and marked up, we can begin to add rich components that will soon match to our Bootstrap compliant website’s function.

Architects should use the following design vocabulary to lay out content, and make it clear to developers “what’s what.” This vocabulary will not at all be foreign to designers and architects. But if the following words are used to describe what’s desired, Bootstrap compliance will emerge out of the unambiguity of meaning when sending requests to developers using Bootstrap, and this is the same language found in the code:
<ul>
	<li><b>Dropdowns</b>, which a lists and nested lists of links;</li>
	<li><b>Button groups</b>, which are clickable sets of buttons;</li>
	<li><b>Button dropdowns</b>, the combination of the two;</li>
	<li><b>Navs</b>, for tabs and pills;</li>
	<li><b>Nav bar</b>, for master navigation;</li>
	<li><b>Breadcrumbs</b>, to display how a user got to a page;</li>
	<li><b>Pagination</b> for long content;</li>
	<li><b>Labels</b> and <b>badges</b> with the same color classes found above;</li>
	<li><b>Thumbnails</b> for any image content</li>
	<li><b>Alerts</b> with the same color classes found above;</li>
	<li><b>Progress bars</b> with the same color classes found above;</li>
</ul>
When using these elements in a design or architecture being passed on to a developer using Bootstrap, be unambiguous about which of these elements are being used. For instance, when sending a PSD or wireframe, use the bolded words above to express what it is you mean with your design or wireframe.
<h3>4. Know your function <small>JavaScript</small></h3>
Now that our content is gridded and given some dynamics with components, perhaps it’s not enough that our website be static after loading. Bootstrap is not only a powerful CSS framework, but a JavaScript mini-library with functions of its own which play nicely with the CSS.

Bootstrap has the following function built in:
<ul>
	<li><b>Transitions</b> for modals, tabs, panes, UI elements;</li>
	<li><b>Modal</b> for alerts, requests for input;</li>
	<li><b>Scrollspy</b> for content that follows the user;</li>
	<li><b>Tab</b> for revealable content;</li>
	<li><b>Tooltip</b> on the top, bottom, left, or right, for quick information;</li>
	<li><b>Popover</b> on the top, bottom, left, or right, for longer information;</li>
	<li><b>Alert</b> when you detect something the user should know;</li>
	<li><b>Button</b>s can change;</li>
	<li><b>Collapse</b> for when information is no longer relevant;</li>
	<li><b>Carousel</b> for sliding through content;</li>
	<li><b>Typeahead</b> for autocomplete</li>
</ul>
Bootstrap compliant site functionality and dynamicism uses the vocabulary found above for seamless architecting and developing. Designers, architects, and developers can learn more about the functions of Bootstrap <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html">on their site</a>.
<h3>5. Make actionable changes <small>Customize</small></h3>
Bootstrap is inherently customizable and can be changed radically very easily thanks to its LESS CSS preprocessor. If you specify changes in the right way, it can take nothing but a few color definitions to take Bootstrap from its default Helvetica blueishness:

<a href="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blue.png"><img alt="blue" src="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/blue-400x197.png"/></a>

To a radical Rutgers red:

<a href="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/red.png"><img  alt="red" src="http://www.localwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/red-400x198.png" /></a>

And this was all done with a <i>single</i> LESS CSS file and a recompile. The way we can make Bootstrap compliant changes through communication is having designers send developers clear variable definition for how to modify Bootstrap. What follows is instructions for both developer and designers to quickly and effectively extend Bootstrap:
<h4>For developers</h4>
The secret to doing this is overriding those variables found in variables.less in a file called <code class='prettyprint'>[your_awesome_project_name].less</code> and <code class='prettyprint'>@import</code>ing it just after <code class='prettyprint'>variables.less</code> in <code class='prettyprint'>bootstrap.less</code> before compiling the CSS. To do this,
<ol>
	<li>Clone the Bootstrap source from GitHub;</li>
	<li>Open a terminal and cd into <code class='prettyprint'>/bootstrap</code>;</li>
	<li>Run <code class='prettyprint'>npm install</code> (assuming you have <a href="https://npmjs.org/">NPM</a> installed);</li>
	<li>Create a new file in <code class='prettyprint'>/less</code> called <code class='prettyprint'>[your_awesome_project_name].less</code>;</li>
	<li>Translate the definitions of the variables found in variables.less that your designer gave you into LESS in your file;</li>
	<li>Add the line <code class='prettyprint'>@import [your_awesome_project_name].less</code> after <code class='prettyprint'>@import variables.less</code> in <code class='prettyprint'>bootstrap.less</code>;</li>
	<li>Return to the terminal and run make and make bootstrap;</li>
	<li>Open up one of the example pages in your browser of choice to confirm everything worked!</li>
</ol>

This is the best way to extend and customize Bootstrap's appearance because it encapsulates all of your changes.

<h4>For designers</h4>
Bootstrap has a small set of variables that affect the way that everything is styled. Using just hex colors and font-families, you can change everything about Bootstrap. To be Bootstrap compliant, send your developer a filled in version of <a href = "https://gist.github.com/PLJNS/6072343">this file</a>.

Examples of how it works:

	@blue:                  #049cdb;             // defining the variable blue as the hex value #049cdb
	@green:                 #46a546;             // defining the variable green
	@bodyBackground:        @green;              // defining the body color as green
	@linkColor:             @lighten(blue, 20%); // defining link color as a 20% lighter blue
	@sansFontFamily:        "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

If you use this template and send it to your developer, you will get exactly the version of Bootstrap you want, with exactly the colors and fonts you want. There is no guessing or ripping colors from PSDs. If Bootstrap compliance can mean anything, it is this unambiguous process with exact results from end-to-end. The colors defined here affect everything from the color classes to the header fonts to the color of margins.

<h4>For everybody!</h4>
If you’d like your own version of Bootstrap, but you’re not a developer or designer, Bootstrap will compile a version for you <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/customize.html">on their site</a>.
<h3>6. Use your resources</h3>
Bootstrap has a tremendous community, and if you’re reading this you’re aware of at least one of the tutorials found on the Internet. Being Bootstrap compliant can mean the design knows what Bootstrap is capable of doing and what’s it has done already. You can find additional components, various framework integrations, interface builders, mockup tools, how tos, and JavaScript addons at <a href="http://bootstraphero.com/the-big-badass-list-of-twitter-bootstrap-resources">BootstrapHero</a>.
<h3>7. Break the rules</h3>
At Local Wisdom, we know that it’s all well and good to have established, refined, and streamlined design and development principles and processes. For some projects, the defaults will work. For others, it’s necessary to build from the ground up. And then there’s the middle ground of when you can use some pre-existing principles and innovate where necessary. So if your design resolution doesn’t fit in 1,200 pixels; If your content cannot be bound in 5 neat color classes; If you want a new design vocabulary; Or if you want function that isn’t generalizable; you need to <a href="http://www.localwisdom.com/blog/2013/07/7-design-principles-at-local-wisdom/">break the rules</a>.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
I love Bootstrap. It’s taught me a lot about web development and it’s an example of the best solution to a problem being the general one. Ultimately, every design is Bootstrap compliant in the sense every design can be expressed in CSS and Bootstrap is a CSS framework. But the meaningful sense of Bootstrap compliance occurs where architects, designers, and developers all assume and know about the possibilities and limitations of the technology, and communicate effectively and in the same language to enact beautiful, awesome web experiences. Which, independently of Bootstrap or any web technology, is always how the best work is done.
