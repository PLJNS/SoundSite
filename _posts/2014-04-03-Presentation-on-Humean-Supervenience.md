This is a video of a presentation of David Lewis' 1994 "Humean Supervenience Debugged", where he deals with the "big bad bug" of chance while holding a Humean Supervenience thesis along with a best-systems account of laws. I made this to practice giving the presentation, which was for Professor Barry Loewer's metaphysics class. I thought recording myself would be a good way to force myself to find out where my presentation needed improvement.
