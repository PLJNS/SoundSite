<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>I was born in June of 1993 in Birmingham, England into an English/Irish home. After three years passed and my sister was born, my family moved to Fleurey-Sur-Ouche, France, where we would spend the next four years. My family moved to the United States of America in 2000, and we settled in New Jersey. In 2012, I became a proud citizen of my adopted country. Now, I live with four awesome people in New Brunswick, NJ. I enjoy playing guitar, drinking coffee, eating New York-style bagels, and running.</p>

<h2>Academic</h2>

<p>I earned an Associate's Degree in Liberal Arts from Mercer County Community College during my last two years of high school. Transferring to Rutgers University in the ensuing Spring of 2012, I declared as both a Computer Science and Philosophy major. I am an active member of the Rutgers undergraduate philosophy community, holding leadership positions in the Philosophy Club, Undergraduate Journal, and Philosophy Honors Society. I graduate after the Fall of 2014, and I am applying to graduate schools for philosophy.</p>

<h2>Professional</h2>

<p>I was hired by Local Wisdom in May of 2012 to work in Research and Development, namely their Weatherwise and Photomash applications. For the current Weatherwise 2.0, I implemented the Theme Store, where users can purchase different themes for the app. For the upcoming Weatherwise 3.0 update, I implemented the app's animation engine across platforms and a Mac application to create Weatherwise themes. I have also worked with the Green Party of New Jersey, student organizations, and friends in building websites.</p>
