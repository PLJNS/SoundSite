<h3>
On Lewis
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
People say that he is the major metaphysician of the 20th century.
</li>
<li>
Pretty standard view of metaphysics, trying to figure out what exists in a general way.
</li>
<li>
What exists &quot;is like.&quot;
</li>
<li>
What Aristotle was doing.
</li>
<li>
For Lewis, would could be and what is are very related.
</li>
<li>
He is most famous for his realism about possible worlds.
</li>
<li><p>
What makes something part of the same world?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Spatio-temporal relations
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
How are worlds specified? If you're making worlds, what're you doing?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You make a spatio-temporal manifold/structure.
</li>
<li>
You need to fill it up with perfectly natural properties in spots.
</li>
<li>
Natural properties and natural relations.
</li>
<li>
You can think of it as being &quot;decorated.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If you're going to specify spatio-temporal structure, what're you going to do?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Points and metrics on the points.
</li>
<li>
People have thought about physics without points.
</li>
<li>
The more he says about possible worlds, the fewer possibilities there are.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Possible worlds have this structure of natural properties and particulars.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
He thought natural properties were the job of physics.
</li>
<li>
What is it about the nature of physics that it's related to natural properties?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If you made a gigantic list of things that exist, some of those things would be possible worlds.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What is it for one thing to be reduced to another?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Physics has the job of what is <em>actually instantiated</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Mosaic of natural properties is what things actually reduced to.
</li>
<li>
Lewis' general metaphysics is a scientific metaphysics.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
In the philosophy community, the realism about possible worlds was greeted with &quot;incredulous stares.&quot;
</p></li>
<li><p>
We're interested in his views about &quot;nomological varieties.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We're interested in his account of laws, which is the Best Systems Account.
</li>
<li>
Which hinges on his account of objective chance.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Objective probability is one of the must <em>useful</em> tools in the natural sciences, but we have no idea what it is.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
He uses this account to give an account of counterfactuals, and these play a gigantically big role in his account of everything else.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Nelson Goodman, &quot;Fact, Fiction, or Forecast&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
In showing that something is sufficient in trying to indentify the laws is by looking at instances, at their role.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is a reductive enterprise.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>
On Laws
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
What was background for Prof. Loewer and what's background for us, those he's teaching, is different.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
When he went to graduate school, the idea of thinking about the metaphysics of laws just wasn't there.
</li>
<li>
There were pragmatic or semantic accounts of laws, but about asking the general way of what it means to be law.
</li>
<li>
<p>Philosophers were using &quot;law&quot; to explain what an event is.</p>
<ul>
<li>
He made use of the idea of law with reference to Goodman on laws.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The way that Lewis got people to think about metaphysics just wasn't on the table.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In recent times, &quot;What is a law?&quot; was put right on the table by Dretske and Armstrong in the 70s and 80s.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
No one has written a history of the scientific account of laws.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Hume thought that laws were sentences that applied in a certain way (pragmatic).
</p></li>
<li>
Ayer had a non-factual view.
</li>
<li>
Hempel and &quot;positive instances of a general law confirm it.&quot;
</li>
<li><p>
What are laws? They are of the form:
</p>

<p>
$$(x)(Fx \to Gx)$$
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you open a textbook in classical or quantum mechanics, you will no longer see sentences of this form.
</li>
<li>
How damaging is this to their project?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Loewer's introduction to philosophy was when he was Amherst College and he wanted to date someone who thought a date was going to a talk by Max Black.
</p></li>
<li>
What is it to be &quot;law-like&quot; and what is the nature of law?
</li>
<li><p>
Hempel's paradox or the Raven paradox.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
How do we understand &quot;confirms&quot;?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If you have a paradox, you can say that a premise is bad, the reasoning form the premises is bad, or you accept the conclusion.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
If something is worth doing, it's worth doing wrong the first time.
</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
  <p>
There's less than meets the eye to Goodman's paradox.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Laws are very special projections.
</li>
<li><p>
Later, many philosophers adopted Goodman's language.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A law is a generalation, but not any generalation.
</li>
<li>
Only predicates that pick out <em>natural properties</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
There's a relationship of support between laws and counterfactuals.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is <em>at least</em> epistemological because if we know the law, we know the counterfactual. But the truth of the counterfactual doesn't mean the law is true.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
How can a regularity explain anything?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is the really err intution.
</li>
<li>
A regularity like all Fs are Gs.
</li>
<li>
A law explains <em>why</em> something is true.
</li>
<li>
Is the law doing the explaining?
</li>
<li>
It's certainly an idea that people like Dretske and Hempel.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
An explanation is a law along with an initial condition.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Armstrong thought that laws were some other part of reality, and they took from Goodman that the predicates must refer to certain kinds of properties.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Gru does not pick out a universal.
</li>
<li>
Does Armstrong think that Green is a universal?
</li>
<li>
A universal is supposed to, those features that are the things that have them are exactly similar to one another.
</li>
<li>
From the point of view of the science of color ...
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
For things to be an electron, it's a natural kind, universal.
</p></li>
<li><p>
An obvious consequence of the powers side is that if laws are things that cannot help but be instantiated.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All the people Loewer knows think that when there are these powers there are these metaphysical connections, if they don't hold this they have to explain what these connections are.
</li>
<li>
Metaphysically necessary connections.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Shoemaker thinks that there is only one possible world -- this one.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All truths are necessary truths.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Take a look a Salmon about Humean and nonHumean.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
&quot;New Work for a Theory of Universals&quot; <small>by David Lewis</small>
</h3>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
The &quot;compulsory question&quot; for systematic philosophy: the question of one over many.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
D.M. Armstrong thinks the answer is a theory of universals, but Lewis doesn't.
</li>
<li>
But universal <em>can</em> do other things.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Although universals may be dispensible.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>Lewis' ontology consists of <em>posibilia</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Along with the &quot;iterative hierarchy of classes built upon them.&quot;
</li>
<li>
Properties are not much like universals, and they cannot do the work of universals.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Posibilia
</dt>
<dd>
Particular, individual things, some of which comprise our actual world and other of which are unactualised.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
Are universals better emplyed as a replacement for posibilia in Lewis' metaphysics?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Not to be considered in this paper.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
In the next section, Lewis will sketch Armstrong's theory of universals, constrasting them with properties understood as <em>classes of posibilia</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Then, he will say why the &quot;One over Many&quot; argument is unconvincing.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Then, how universals help him in connection with the topics of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Duplication
</li>
<li>
Supervenience
</li>
<li>
Divergent worlds
</li>
<li>
Minimal form for materialism
</li>
<li>
Laws and causation
</li>
<li>
Content of language and thought
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
And perhaps the list could be extended
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Universals and Properties
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Language offers several more or less interchangable words, that is &quot;universal&quot; and &quot;property&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;attribute&quot; ...</p>
<ul>
<li>
Also &quot;characteristic&quot; and &quot;kind&quot; and &quot;sort&quot; and &quot;type.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Universal
</dt>
<dd>
Those entities, if such there be, that mostly conform to Armstrong's account.
</dd>

<dt>
Property
</dt>
<dd>
Classes, any classes, but formemost classes of things.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
To be a member of a class.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Why call them <strong>properties</strong> as well as <strong>classes</strong>?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
They do not need to be classes of <em>actual</em> things.
</li>
<li>
The property of being a donkey is the class of <em>all</em> the donkeys.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Relation
</dt>
<dd>
Arbitrary classes of ordered pairs, triples, ... A relation among things is a property of tuples of things. With no restriction to actual things.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
Universals and properties are different in two ways.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Their instantiation
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It is a contituent part of each particular that has it.
</li>
<li>
A property is &quot;spread around.&quot;
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
The property of being a donkey is partyly present wherever there is a donkey, in this or any other world. Far from the property being part of the donkey, it is closer to the truth to say that the donkey is part of the property. But the precise truth, rather, is that the donkey is a member of the property.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Thus universals would unify reality in a way that properties do not.
</li>
<li>
Things that share a universal have not just joined a single class. They literally have something in common. They are not entirely distinct. They overlap.
</li>
<li>
Universals defy intuitive principles. *The intuitions were made for particulars*.
</li>
<li>
<em>Is copresense transitive?</em> <strong>No</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Round, silver, golden. Silver and round are copresent, for here is a silver coin. Golden and round are copresent, for there is a round coin; but silver and golden are no copresent.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Their abundance. This is the difference that qualifies for different work.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Universal are sparse in Armstrong's work. *There are the universals that that there must be to ground the resemblences and causal powers of things, and there is no reason to believe in any more.* These would be rejected:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Not golden
</li>
<li>
Golden or wooden
</li>
<li>
Metallic
</li>
<li>
Self-identical
</li>
<li>
Owned by Fred
</li>
<li>
Belonging to class <em>C</em>
</li>
<li>
Grue
</li>
<li>
First examined before 2000 A.D.
</li>
<li>
Being identical
</li>
<li>
Being alike in some respect
</li>
<li>
Being exactly alike
</li>
<li>
Being part of
</li>
<li>
Owning
</li>
<li>
Being paired with by some part in <em>R</em>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
The world's universals should comprise of a minimal basis for characterizing the world completely.
</p></li>
<li>
Universals that do not contribute to this or are redundant are unwelcome.
</li>
<li>
<em>A non-linguistic counterpart of a primitavely vocabulary for a language capable of describing the world exhaustively.</em>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Copresent
</dt>
<dd>
Two entities are <em>copresent</em> if both are wholly present at one position in space and time.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
It is quite different for <em>properties</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Any class of things, regardless of characteristic of the class, is a property.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
So they are of immense abundance.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>There are so many properties that those specifiable in English, or in the brain's language of synaptic interconnections and neural spikes, could be only an infitesimal minority.</strong>
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
There so many properties that any two things share an infinite amount of properties and fail to share inifitely many as well.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
This is so whether the two things are duplicates or utterly dissimilar.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Properties do not capture resemblence.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Properties are causally irrelevant.
</p></li>
<li>
Properties &quot;carve reality at the joints.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Natural properties
</dt>
<dd>
Properties whose sharing makes for resemblance, and the ones relevant to causal powers.
</dd>

<dt>
Perfectly natural properties
</dt>
<dd>
If the members of the class are all and only those things that share some one universal.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
An <em>adequate</em> theory of propeties is one that recognizes an objective difference between natural and unnatural properties.
</li>
<li>
A Nominalistic theory of properties could achieve adequacy by drawing primitive distinctions between particulars.
</li>
<li>
A Nominalist in pursuit of adequacy might prefer to rest with primitive objective resemblance among things.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Nominalism
</dt>
<dd>
the doctrine that universals or general ideas are mere names without any corresponding reality, and that only particular objects exist; properties, numbers, and sets are thought of as merely features of the way of considering the things that exist.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
At this point, it could be a good idea to believe in universals *as well as* properties.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;Properties have work of their own, and universals are ill-suited to do the work of properties.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Consider these sentences:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Red resembles organge more than it resembles blue.
</li>
<li>
Red is a color.
</li>
<li>
Humility is a virtue.
</li>
<li>
Redness is a sign of ripeness.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<em>Prima facie</em>, these sentences contain names to denote individual things.
</p></li>
<li><p>
It is unlikely that there are universals for colors, especially particular colors.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Unless you subject the phrases to paraphrasing.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Let <em>x</em> range over things, <em>P</em> over properties (classes) of things. Then:
</p>

<p>
<span class="math">\[\exists_1 P \Box \forall x (x \in P \equiv 0x)\]</span>
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
One Over Many
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Armstrong's main argument is the &quot;One over Many&quot; argument.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It is <em>because</em> that Lewis finds this unsatisfactory that he is seeking alternatives.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
An effort at systemic philosophy must give an account of purpoted fact.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
I deny it.
</li>
<li>
I analyse it thus ... .
</li>
<li>
I accept it as primitive.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Moorean fact
</dt>
<dd>
one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of any philosophical argument to the contrary
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
An adequate Nominalism is a theory that takes Moorean facts of apparent sameness of a type as primitive.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Universals are one possible solution, but not the only, and not even the best (?).
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Early in <em>Universals</em> it &quot;undergoes an unfortunate double transformation.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The <em>analysandum</em> becomes the schema:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>a</em> has the property <em>F</em>.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The turning point takes only two sentences:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
How is [the Nominalist] to account for the apparent (if usually partial) identity of numerically different particulars? How can two different things both be white or both be on a table?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;There are no universals but the proposition <em>a</em> is <em>F</em> is perfectly alright as it is.&quot; (Dodging the question.)
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Class Nominalism</strong> fails because it employs predications of class membership, which predications it cannot without circularity analyze in terms of class membership.
</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Resemblance Nominalism</strong> fails to analyze predications of resemblance.
</li>
<li>
Predications of particpation evade analysis.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Duplication, Supervinience, and Divergent Worlds
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
From now on, they'll only be natural, unnatural, or more-or-less natural properties.
</li>
<li>
Beginning the analysis with <em>duplication</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Duplication
</h5>

<dl>
<dt>
Duplication
</dt>
<dd>
Ex, uing a copying machine. A perfect copier would make the two items the same in terms of atomic structure, making the two items, the copy and the original, indiscernible.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Two things are duplicates if and only if they have precisely the same intrinsic properties, however much their extrinisic properties might differ.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Intrinsic property
</dt>
<dd>
Property <em>P</em> is instrinsic if and only if, for any two duplicate things, not necessarily from the same world, either both have <em>P</em> or neither does.
</dd>

<dt>
Extrinsic property
</dt>
<dd>
Property <em>P</em> is extrinsic if and only in there is some such pair of duplicates of which one has <em>P</em> and the other lacks <em>P</em>.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
If we relied on physical theory to be accurate and exhaustive, we might define duplication in physical terms.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
But this definition is no analysis because it presupposes the contigent physics of this actual world.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Duplication is better analyzed in terms of <em>shared properties</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
To begin with <em>natural properties</em> and then move to <em>intrinsic properties</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If Materialism were false and physics an utter failures, as it is in some deplorable worlds, there would still be duplication in terms of <em>shared natural properties</em>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
All <em>perfectly natural properties</em> are <em>intrinsic properties</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
However, intrinsic properties can be disjunctive and miscellaneous and unnatural, so long as they never differ between duplicates.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Duplication is important for two topics in metaphysics: supervenience and divergent worlds.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Supervenience
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
A supervenience thesis is a denial of indepedant variation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It can be defined with <em>posibilia</em>.
</li>
<li><p>
To say that so-and-so supervenes on such-and-such is to stay there can be no idefference in respect to so-and-so without difference in respect to such-and-such.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Beauty of statues supervenes on their shape, size, and colour, for instance, if no two statures, in the same or different worlds, ever differ in beauty without also differing in shape or size or colour.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A supervenience thesis is cautiously reductionist.
</p></li>
<li>
The worst that can happen is that an ascription of a supervenient property is equivilent to an uncountably infinite disjunction of maximally specfic descriptions of the other property.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Local duplicates
</dt>
<dd>
Two worlds are <em>local duplicates</em> just in case they are divisible into corresponding small parts in such that that: 1. Corresponding parts of the two worlds are duplicates, and 2. The correspondence preserves spatiotemporal relations.
</dd>
</dl>

<h5>
Divergent worlds
</h5>

<dl>
<dt>
Diverge
</dt>
<dd>
Two possible worlds <em>diverage</em> just in case they are not duplicates but they do duplicate initial temporal segmant. For example, our world and another might match perfectly up through the year 1945, and go their separate ways thereafter.
</dd>

<dt>
Branching
</dt>
<dd>
Instead of duplicate segments, one and the same initial segment is allegedly share as a common part of two overlapping worlds.
</dd>

<dt>
Determinism
</dt>
<dd>
A system of laws of nature is Determinsitic just in case no two divergent worlds both conform perfectly to the laws of that system.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
A world is Deterministic just in case its laws comprise a Determinsitic system.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Determinism is the thesis that our world is Deterministic.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Minimal Materialism
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a difficulty in definining reductionist views as supervenience theses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The solution is to employ <em>natural properties</em> not only by way of <em>duplication</em> but in a <em>more direct way</em> also.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Materialism
</dt>
<dd>
The these that physics is a comprehensive theory of the world, complete as well as correct.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
The world is as physics says it is, and there's no more to say.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Materialism is not a thesis of finite translatability of all our language into the language of physics.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Materialism is not to be indentified with any one Materialist theory of mind. It is a thesis that motivates a varity of theories of mind:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Behaviorism
</li>
<li>
Functionalism
</li>
<li>
The mind-body identity theory
</li>
<li>
Mind is a mistake
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Materialism is not just the theory that there are no things except those things indentified by physics. Materialism <em>don't</em> believe in spirit, or other such nonphysical things.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Materialism is at least in part the thesis that there are no natural properties instantiated at our world except those recognized by physics. Couldn't ther be a natural property <em>X</em> which is shared by the physical brains in worlds like ours and the immaterial spirits that inhabit other worlds? Or by thisworldy quarks and otherwordly particles that cannot exist under our physics?
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>(M1)</strong>: Any two possible worlds that are exactly alike in all respects recognized by physics are qualitative duplicates.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
This will not do. A world could differ in having Materialism false, as it is contigent and non-physical, and then you could have epiphenomenal spirits and not differ physically by not be a qualititative duplicate.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>(M2)</strong>: There is no differe, <em>a fortiori</em> no mental difference, without some nonmental difference. Any two worlds alike in all nonmental respect are duplicate, and in particular do not differ in respect of the mental lives of their inhabitants.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
This fails, I think, because worlds can differ in the mental lives of the inhabitants but be physically identical (?).
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>(M3)</strong>: No two Materialistic worlds differ without differing physically; any two Materialistic worlds that are exactly alike physically are duplicates.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Any world, however spirit=ridden, belongs to such a class.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>(M4)</strong>: Among worlds that conform to the actual laws of nature, no two differ without differing physically; any two worlds that are exactly alike physically are duplicates.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
Less that Materialism because M4 could hold a world where Materialism is false but where spiritual phenomena are correlated with physical phenomena accords to strict laws.
</p></li>
<li><p>
More than Materialism because M$ fails to hold at a Materialistic, spirit-free world if the laws of the world do not preculd the existence of epiphenomenal spirts. &quot;Absent, but not outlawed.&quot;
</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>(M5)</strong>: Among worlds where no natural properties are alien to our world are instantiated, no two differ without differing physically; any two such worlds that are exactly alike physically are duplicated.
</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt>
Alien property
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A property is <em>alien</em> to a world just in case:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
It is not instantiated by any inhabitant of that world;
</li>
<li>
It is not analysable as a conjunction of, or as a structural property constractu out of, natural properties all of which are instantiated by inhabitants of that world.
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Laws and Causation
</h4>

<h5>
Laws
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>What is it to be a law of nature?</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
You need universals, or at least natural properties, to explain lawhood.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Armstrong's theory holds that what makes regularities lawful are second-order state of affais <em>N(F,G)</em> in which the two ordinary, first-order universals <em>F</em> and <em>G</em> are related by a certain dyadic second-order universal <em>N</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The &quot;lawmaker&quot; <em>N</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
But I say that N deserves the name of 'necessitation' only if, somehow, it really can enter into the requisite necessary connections. It can't enter into them just by bearing a name, any more than one can have mighty biceps just by being called 'Armstrong'.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Necessary connection can be unintelligible even when they are supposed to obtain between existences that are not clearly and wholly distinct.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Some regularity is accidental, but laws are regularities.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
So we must be selective.
</li>
<li>
Reject &quot;lawlikeness&quot; plus truth.
</li>
<li><p>
A suitabl system has:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The virtues we aspire to in &quot;our own theory-building.&quot;
</li>
<li>
Has them to the greatest extent possible.
</li>
<li>
Must be entirely true.
</li>
<li>
It must be closed under strict implication.
</li>
<li>
It must be as simple in axiomatisation as it can be without sacrificing to much information content.
</li>
<li>
It must have as much information content as it can without sacrificing too much simplicity.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The ideal system need not consist entirely of regularities, particular facts may gain entry if they contribute enough to collective simplicity and strength.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Causation
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
Causation involves laws
</li>
<li>
We need the kind of counterfactuals that avoid backtracking
</li>
<li><p>
Causation holds between events.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you put butter on the skillet, it melts, what causes this?</p>
<ul>
<li>
There is one event that we can call a moving of molecules.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Heat is that phemonemon.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It occurs in virtue of two facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
That the skillet's molecules are moving rapidly.
</li>
<li>
That the region in question is part of a world where molecular motion is what occupies the heat-role.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
The Content of Language and Thought
</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>
The principles of charity will impute a bias toward believing that things are green rather than grue, toward having a basic desire for long life rather than for long-life- unless-one-was born-on-Monday-and-in-that-case-life-for- an-even-number-of-weeks. In short, they will impute eligible content, where ineligibility consists in severe unnaturalness of the properties the subject supposedly believes or desires or intends himself to have. They will impute other things as well, but it is the imputed eligibility that matters to us at present.
</p>

<h3>
Presentation on &quot;New Work for a Theory of Universals&quot;
</h3>

<h4>
Set Up
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Armstrong
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Accept an entity &quot;wholly present whereever it is instantiated&quot; that's a &quot;constituent part ... of each particular that has it.&quot; Accept universals! Universals make for <em>objective similarity</em> and <em>unify reality</em> - Similar things <em>literally</em> overlap.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Lewis
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Has <em>possibilia</em> and <em>classes of possibilia</em>
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Aim to show</strong>: Lewis needs to add something to his basic ontology to do some work.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Explain the difference between universals and properties
</li>
<li>
Show how universals can do important work that properties cannot.
</li>
<li>
Once this job is done, you can do a lot of other work.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>The work</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Similarity
</li>
<li>
Duplication
</li>
<li>
Supervinience
</li>
<li>
Determinism
</li>
<li>
Materialism
</li>
<li>
Determinacy of content
</li>
<li>
Laws
</li>
<li>
Causation
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Sidequest 1</strong>: Show that Amrstron's argument for universals (one over many) isn't good.
</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Sidequest 2</strong>: Show that we still need properties. Universal cannot do all the work.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Universals and Properties
</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>
Universals are <em>located</em> wholly where their instances are, are part of their instances.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Properties are spread out, their instance are &quot;part of&quot; them.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Universals are <em>sparse</em>. There are only enough to account for the similarity facts.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Properties are abundant, there are tons of them.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h4>
Basic Job - Similarity
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Upshot of fact 2</strong>: Universal can account for similarity. Properties <em>cannot</em>.
</li>
<li>
Make some properties shin. They are the natural properties and account make for similarity.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Primitive naturalness
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Some properties are natural, some aren't.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Primitive resemblance
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The members of this plurality resemble each other more than they do the members of any other plurality. Resemblance is primitive.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Duplication
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Problem
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Duplicate are analyzed in terms of sharing <em>intrinsic properties</em>. Intrinsic properties are analyzed as those shared by duplicates.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Solution
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Duplicates are those things that share perfectly natural properties.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Duplications are those things whose parts bear isomorphisms and share natural properties and relations.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Supervenience
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>A</em>s supervene on the <em>B</em>s when similarity among <em>B</em>s means similarity among <em>A</em>s.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Using our fancy new duplication stuff: If duplicating the <em>B</em>s means match among <em>A</em>s.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Determinism
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Problem
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
&quot;Every event has a cause&quot; ignore probabilistic cause. &quot;Ideal predictor&quot; ignores &quot;obstacle to calculation.&quot;
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Solution
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Divergent worlds are not duplicates, but have duplicate initial segments. Deterministic laws don't allow for digergent worlds. Determinstics worlds are worlds with determinstic laws.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Materialism
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Problem
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Want materialism to be:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Contigent
</li>
<li>
Involve physics
</li>
<li>
Allow for panpsychism
</li>
<li>
Account for the &quot;something extraness&quot; of spooks
</li>
<li>
Account for the &quot;sufficiency of the physical&quot;
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>
Solution
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Alien properties aren't instantiated at our world, nor constructible from out natural properties. Materialism says that in worlds without alien properties, worlds alike physically are duplicates.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Content
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Putnam
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If content is fixed by what satisifes (idealidized) theory, it's indeterminate.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Kripkenstein
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No proper subsequence of use determines next element.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Solution
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
We need more constraints. If constraints are causal, natural properties &quot;get in.&quot;
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Lewis
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Some properties are inherently eligible to be referents to our words. Objects become eligible by instantiating eligible properties.
</p>

<p>
Eligibility is proportional to naturalness. Content is determined by maximizing fit with use and eligibility.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Laws
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Problem
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Why are some regularities laws and others not?
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Armstrong
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A regularity &quot;All Fs are Gs&quot; is a law <abbr title="if and only if">iff</abbr> necessitation holds between F and G
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Lewis
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This is unintelligible
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
We must treat regularities not one at a time, but rather as candidates to enter into integrated sysmtes. For a given regularity might hold either as a law or accidentally, depending on whether other regulairties obtain that can fit together with it in a suitable system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
A suitable system has virtues we can aspire to:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Truth
</li>
<li>
Closed under strict implication
</li>
<li>
Simple
</li>
<li>
Informative
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
Need a restriction on language we can use.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Acount is trivialized otherwise.
</li>
<li>
What is the primitive language of the laws? <em>The perfectly natural properties, of course!</em>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The best system yses perfectly natural predicates for its primitive vocabulary, has properties (1) and (2), and has the best tradeoff between (3) and (4).
</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
<abbr title="Best system account">BSA</abbr>
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
<abbr title="Best system account">BSA</abbr>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A law is a regularity of the best system. A fundamental law is an axiom.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Causation
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Lewis
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>C</em> is a cause of <em>E</em> <abbr title="if and only if">iff</abbr> the closesnt non-bracktacking worlds in which <em>C</em> does not occur that evolve in accordance with the laws are were <em>E</em> does not occur.
</p>

<p>
Natural properties show up in laws, so they show up in causes too Non-backtracking is understood in terms of divergent worlds. Another place for natural properties.
</p>

<p>
Only <em>genuine events</em> can cause. Natural properties pick out genuine events.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Natural Properties and Physics
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Physics &quot;aspires to give an inventory of natural properties.&quot; Why think this?
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
There are <strong>three arguments</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
<li><dl>
<dt>
M5/Materialism
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
&quot;In putting forward comprehensive theories, physics proposes investorys of the natural properties instanstiated in our world.&quot; Lewis claims that comprehensiveness of physics should be understood in terms of M5. The link between natural properties and duplication is supposed to support a link between natural properties and physics.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>
Laws causes
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Physicists search for laws of nature and causes. If laws must be sated in the language of natural properties, then physicists search for natural properties and succeed when they find laws.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>
Similarities and Differences
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Physicists seek to tell us about the real similarities and difference between things. &quot;Cutting nature at its joints.&quot; This is the first <em>job</em> of natural properties.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Natural Properties and Induction
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Lewis doesn't say a whole lot to link natural properties and induction. It seems he is poised to answer Goodman's riddle. He got a way of separating green and guem and that's the important thing. But we still need a way to explain why natural properties are projectable.
</li>
<li><p>
The closest thing we find to a treatment is in the &quot;Content&quot; bit.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Paraphrase</strong>: &quot;We need principles of charity. Such principles call for interpretations accord to which the subject has attitudes we deem reasonable. They impose presumptions about what inductive biases someone may be righly interpreted to have. We need natural propertoes. Principles of charity impute a bias towards believing green rather than grue.&quot;
</li>
<li><p>
Two ways to take this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Induction first: Natural properties detemine which properties it is reasonable to project directly. Content is fixed by that somehow. (Weatherson)
</li>
<li>
Content first: Natural properties determine which contents are eligibile. Rationality of induction is fixed by that somehow.
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Perhaps most reasonable</strong>: natural properties play a certain role in lawlikeness and counterfactuals. This allows them to figure into two roles Goodman identified for projectable predicates.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Physical Magnitudes and Determinates
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
We should expect some physical mangitudes (mass, charge) to be perfectly natural. We should be surprised is some determinaites are perfectly natural.
</li>
<li><p>
But magnitudes and determinates exclude each other.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Nothing is 5 <em>and</em> 7kg. Nothing is red <em>and</em> blue. How is this possible? Necessary connections among distinct existents?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Two proposals:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Add some necessary connections!
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclusion is nomically necessary, based on nomic necessity of magnitudes and dense linear orders.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Exclusion of dense linear orders is logically and metaphysically necessary.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>
What is Humean Supervenience?
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
Human Supervenience
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
<strong>Truth supervenes on being</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All the facts about the world supervene on facts about which individuals instantiate which fundamental properties and relations.
</li>
<li>
This is the core part of Lew's metaphysics.
</li>
<li>
Lewis thinks the fundamental properties and relations of the world characterize the world <em>without redunancy</em>
</li>
<li><p>
If <em>earlier than</em> and <em>later than</em> are fundamental, then there is some redunadancy in the characterization of the world in terms of fundamental properties.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
But it's hard to see how one is fundamental and the other isn't.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
We'll stick to fundamental properties characterizing the world <em>completely</em>.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Anti-haeccaetism</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All the facts about a world supervene on the distribution of qualitative properties and relation.
</li>
<li>
Rearranging which properties hang on which 'hooks' doesn't change any facts.
</li>
<li>
Consider what it would be like for anti-haeccaetism to fail. There would have to be two worlds, with the same distribution of qualitative properties, but with different facts obtaining in each.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Spatio-temporalism</strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The only fundamental relations that are actually instantiated are spatio-temporal, and all fundamental properties are properties of points or point-sized occupants of points.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

Strong Modal <abbr title="Humean Supervenience">HS</abbr>

What is Perfect Naturalness?
</h4>

We do need to understand what it is to be <em>fundamental</em> and <em>perfectly natural</em>.

they have exactly the same <em>perfectly natural properties</em>, and

Perfectly natural properties

There is a small class of properties and relations such that the facts at any world supervene on the distribution of these properties and relations.

Each of these properties is an intrinsic property.

At the actual world, the only relations among these which are instantiated are spatio-temporal, and all the contigent facts supervene not merely on the distribution of fundamental qualities and relations, but also on the distribution of fundamental qualties and relations <em>over points and point-sized occupants of points</em>.

February 3rd, 2013 <small>Armstrong, <em>What is a Law of Nature?</em></small>
</h2>

<h3>
Introduction
</h3>

<h4>
The importantance of our topic
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
The question, &quot;What is a law of nature&quot; is central to philosophy of science.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
But also to epistemology and metaphysics.
</li>
<li>
In this section, Amstrong will establish why it's important both narrowly and broadly.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Natural science has three tasks.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Geography and history of the universe.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Taking &quot;geography&quot; to cover space and &quot;history&quot; to cover time.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Discover what sorts of thing and what sorts of property there are in the universe and how they are constituted.
</p></li>
<li>
State the laws which the things in space and time obey.
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
It may not be obvious that there is a second task to be distinguished from the third.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Heat <em>is</em> molecular motion is not a historical or geographical truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
This is not a law of nature or a &quot;bridge law&quot;
</li>
<li>
It is something different, a constituate of a property or range of properties in terms of more ultimate properties.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
These three inquiries are inextricably linked.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
They can only be pursued in conjunction.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If discovery of law is of the traditional tasks of natural science, then the nature of a law of nature must be a central ontological concern for philosophy of science.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The question of &quot;What is a law of nature?&quot; has a wider and philosophical importance.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>only</em> relation that allows us to move from observed matters of fact to <em>unobserved</em> matters of fact is cause and effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Without this, we cannot move beyond observation.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If you appeal to Hume, you can say that inferences to particular unobserved phenomena would be unreliable without laws of nature.
</p></li>
<li><p>
But you don't have to.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The proposition is obvious enough in itself.
</li>
<li>
The scientist trying to establish the geography and history of the ubobserved universe must depends on laws.
</li>
<li>
<p>When we make day-to-day inferences, it's not as important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
It's still irrational to make inferences without laws.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Hume: &quot;Inference from the observed to the unobserved is central to our whole life as humans.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Without such laws, inferences would not be reliable.
</li>
<li>
Hence, important question for <em>epistemology</em>.
</li>
<li>
<p>If so, we want to know about its <em>ontology</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We will want to know what a law <em>is</em>.
</li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>
The view that would evade this arguments would the view that, &quot;althought there are regularities in the world, there are no laws of nature.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It &quot;denies that the world contains anything except these regularities.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Problem with this view: What reason we can to think the world is regular.

Problem of induction, too.

<h4>
A possible difficulty in investigating our topic
</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Paradox of Analysis</strong>: If we ask what sore of thing an X is then either we know what an X is or we do not. If we know, then there is no need to ask the question. If we do not, we have no way to begin the investigation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
The solution? We have a fuzzy notion and we're reflecting on it.
</li>
<li><p>
If we can securely get instances of X, you can &quot;tie the inquiry down.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If we can be sure that an <em>a</em> is an X, then we can use other things which we know or believe about <em>a</em> to check the proposed account of X.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>The Problem</strong>: There are no secure paradigms of laws of nature.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider contemporary natural science. It is perfectly epistemically possible that we dont know a single law of nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
This may be the handicap to answering the question, of what is a law of nature.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Even though we can point to no secure paradigm of laws, the scientific theories we now work with contain what at least some real laws of nature.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If our theories do no nearly grasp the truth, we would be unable to explain why so many predictions are succesful.
</li>
<li><p>
We do theoritical calculations allow us to get safely to and from the moon?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Can hardly be mere fantasy.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
We can make an inference to the best explanation from the predicition success of contemporary science to the such theories have tolerable accuracy.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Even some pre-science laws are pretty good.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Consider these examples:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fire burns
</li>
<li>
Bread nourishes
</li>
<li>
Water suffocates
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If these were not true, then we would all be dead.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This indicates the importance of fighting skepticism about this topic.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
He considers this a <strong>reply</strong>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The secone <strong>response</strong> to the objection is that we know the <em>forms</em> that the laws take.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Consider these forms that use dummies:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
It is a law that Fs are Gs.
</li>
<li>
It is a law that an F has a certain probability of being a G.
</li>
<li>
It is a law that the quantities of P and Q co-vary in such a way that Q is certain functino of P (Q = f(P)).
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
We can largely proceed with these schemata.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Philosophers cannot make any serious contribution to the <em>scientific</em> project of actually determining the laws.
</li>
<li>
To every subject, its appropriate level of abstraction.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If concrete examples are required, there are examples in current and earlier science.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Newton's Law is not <em>strictly</em> a law, but an approximation of a wide range of phenomena.
</li>
<li>
It makes for a good stand-in for a law of nature.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Assumptions
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: The truth of a Realisitic account of laws of nature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
That they exist indepedantly of the minds which attempt to grasp them.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Law-statements
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
May be true or fase. If they are true, what <em>makes them true</em> is a law.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
Behind all anti-Realist views of laws stands the <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Regularities are the Realistic component of anti-Realist theories of laws.</p>
<ul>
<li>
As a result, a destructive critique of Regularity theory will undermine anti-Realist theories of laws.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Assumption</strong>: On Realism about universals.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Not even the Regularity theory can be developed without universals.
</li>
<li>
The Realist about laws who wishes to go beyond Regularity must use universals.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Assumption</strong>: Actualism
</p></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Actualism
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
We should not postualte any particulars except actual particulars, not any properties and relations save actual, or categorical, properties and relations.
</p>

<p>
This debars us not from the past and future, but from using the merely possible, both logical and physical.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
The Regularity Theory
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
There are many who would <em>like</em> regularity theory to be true.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This influence makes it powerful.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
In the course of the criticism, we'll see what a good theory of laws <em>ought</em> to do.
</p></li>
<li>
After disposing of Regularity theory, it will be shown that any satisfactory account of laws must involve universals, and irreducible relations between them.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Critique of the Regularity theory (1) <small>The problem of accidental uniformities</small>
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Laws of nature characteristically <em>manifest</em> themselves or <em>issue</em> regularity
</li>
<li>
Philosophers usually think of a Regularituy theory of <em>causation</em>, but what is considered here is a Regularity theory of <em>laws</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
<abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr> of Causation
</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>
That causal connection is a species of law-like connection.
</li>
<li>
That laws are nothing but regularities in the behavior of things.
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
The naive regularity theory of law
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
George Molnar's criticism of Regularity theory of laws
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Outline of a theory called <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr> of laws of nature, called <em>Naive Regularity</em> theory.
</li>
<li>
He then considers an argument against such a theory, an argument from unrealized physical possibilities.
</li>
<li>
He then argues that none of the judicious modifications in spirit of the theory are satisfactory.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
But the tactic can be generalized to <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr> in general, not just laws.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>p</em> is a <strong>statement</strong> of a law of nature just in case:
</p>
  
<ol>
  <li>
<em>p</em> is universally quantified
</li>
  <li>
<em>p</em> is [omnitemporally and omnispatially] true
</li>
  <li>
<em>p</em> is contigent
</li>
  <li>
<em>p</em> contains only non-local empirical predicates, apart from logical connectives and quantifiers.
</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h4>
Classification of ciriticisms of the <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr>
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
If we take &quot;Humean uniformities&quot; and try to identify them with &quot;the laws of nature&quot;, difficulties of identification arise.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are Humean uniformities that are not laws.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Being a Humean uniformity is not <em>sufficient</em> to be a law of nature.
</li>
<li>
There are laws that do not apply at all times, there are laws which are probabilistic.
</li>
<li>
So it's also not necessary that a law of nature be a Humean uniformity.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Even if these difficulties can be overcome, there are others.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It is a law that all Fs are Gs just in case all Fs are Gs where the latter is a Humean regularity
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The &quot;intensional&quot; difficulties are in Chapter 4.
</p></li>
<li>
Chapter 5 will Chisolm until it is clear it's not worth it.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Single-case uniformities
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
The laws of nature are, at best, a sub-class of the class of <abbr title="Humean unformities">HUs</abbr>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A recognized research programme is finding a wa to cut out the unwanted <abbr title="Humean unformities">HUs</abbr> will remaining faithful to <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr>.
</li>
<li>
This first case is <em>against</em> Naive <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr>, which identifies laws and <abbr title="Humean uniformity">HU</abbr>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Probably, every object in the univers differs in its properties from every other object.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>By this, general, non-local properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
&quot;Living in Australia&quot; is not a property.
</li>
<li>
&quot;Being a light-second distant from proton A&quot; is not a general relation property.
</li>
<li>
&quot;Being a light-second distant from a proton&quot; would be satisfactory.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
For each particular, therefore, it is likely that there exists at least one <em>individual conjunction</em> of properties, that is, a conjunction of properties.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
How to pass from single-case uniformitie ot multi-case uniformities
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Given a plurality of single-case <abbr title="Humean uniformity">HU</abbr>, we can immediately construct plural-case <abbr title="Humean uniformity">HU</abbr> which have no reason to believe are manifestations of laws of nature.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider individuating conjuctions of properties A, B, and C associated with particulars <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We can say that whenever an object is of the sort then it further has the property.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The problem of to exclude a disjunctive set of affairs is a close cousing to the problem introduced by Nelson Goodman with the predicates &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Suppose all things green turn blue after 2000, and all blue things green.
</li>
<li>
Rlative to the predicates &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; all things change.
</li>
<li>
The problem is to say why one set of predicates should have preference over the other.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A Regularity account of laws to be developed in a Realistic way must be stipulated that only certain non-local predicates can be used to state &quot;uniformities.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Admissible predicates must carve reality along some join, natural, unified, objectively resembling class of phenomena.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Otherwise these &quot;uniformities&quot; are not <em>uniformities</em>.

What makes a possible world?

<ul>
<li>
Unclear: Sometimes he writes as though there spacetime points, sometimes he writes as though there are others.
</li>
<li><p>
If he wrote a list:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Spacetime structure
</li>
<li>
Spacetime points
</li>
<li>
Fields, particles

</ul></li>

His ontology becomes very <em>sparse</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>I guess</em> he's commit to a substanvilism (...)
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Natural properties, one way of understanding them is special sets.

<li>
<p>Special in a couple ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Exemplifictions in all possible worlds (...)
</li>
<li>
Supervinience
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Everything is <em>made true</em> by something in his ontology.
</p></li>
<li>
He didn't want to rule out alien, that is unconcievable, properties, structures, and individuals.
</li>
<li><p>
It's easy to think that the natural properties have intrinsic natures.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
He's open to the idea.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Strawson has this idea that we're <em>acquinted</em> with intrinsic natures.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What's the <em>intrisic nature</em> of being a quark?</p>

For him, that is Strawson, it's an experiential argument.

What does Lewis say about this and extrinsic/intrinsic?

<ul>
<li>
There's a footnote in New Work that covers this, very complicated.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Two people are trans-world duplicates if they share all relations, including extrinsic. However, any individual is a trans-world duplicate doesn't require extrinsic properties.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If the world were gruesome, scientists would come up with predicates and terms, reference magnetism would make their laws false.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>As a matter of fact</em>, the world is gruesome, but the predicates used aren't. If this was the kind of thing that happened, then scientists would formulate laws which would satisfy them, but from the POV of Lewis' God, it'd be unsatisfactory.
</li>
<li>
<p>The question is, about grue, is this epistemically accessible?</p>
<ul>
<li>
If physicists could be fooled by this sort of gruesomeness, this would be bad for Lewis.

<li><p>
The thought that the theory of content will make it the case because of the use-features in an ideal theory look like it may not mitigate against ... because the theory is ideal.

The Problem of the F
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Among the candidate systems, there are systems that are maximally simple, manixmally informative, yet obviously not the best, such as the system axiomatized by only one universal generalization whose predicate applies to all and only the things in the actual world.

<p>Two potential ways to solve The Problem of the F:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Constaint the language that is used to formualte the candidate system.
</li>
<li>
Constrain the metric that is used to evaluate the candidate system.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

How should we modify <abbr title="Best system account">BSA</abbr> if we give up naturalness?

What should the reductionist say about the constraint on metrics.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Language-Objectivity
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
There is an objective, mind-indepedant language to formulate the candidate system in. Such a language contains predicates that only refer to perfectly natural properties.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Mike</strong>: It depends why you're buying in to Lewis' metaphysics. It depends if you're a Humean or not.
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Barry</strong>: We want it to be the case that the physicists pick out the laws that are true. ... The distinction between natural and non-natural to be non-mysterious. There's one sense in which natural and non-natural if these notions get their content from the theories proposed, then there's a problem. Lewis places priority on natural properties and then includes it in his <abbr title="Best system account">BSA</abbr>, whereas others will use <abbr title="Best system account">BSA</abbr> to define the properties that are natural properties depending on the aims of science.
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Barry</strong>: On one view, we're chasing &quot;something out there.&quot; On another, what's natural is not out there. (...)
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Barry</strong>: Philosophers spend a lot of time convincing people that there's a problem, and the rest of their time convincing people there's no problem.
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Niko</strong>: It's just a part of the sociology of philosophers that if someone draws a primitive distinction, someone will complain and try to do the same work without it.
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Barry</strong>: If the story of content guarenteed that the physicists got the laws, that'd be okay. It seems implausible that looking for simple and informative theories of the world would need natural properties ...
</p>
  
<p>
Instead of starting with the language of natural properties and the various systems formulated in this language, start with both languages and systems together and evaluate them together, the laws will be the best combination of language and systems. What counts as the language? A supervinience base for a lot else - and some other things.

<h4>
Eddon and Meacham's Choice <small>Language-Salience and Metrics-Rigidity</small>
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>E+M argue that the best options are LS and MR. They think that these two are not problem-free, but they stand on firmer grounds than the other options.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Against the other options, they advance several objections.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Indexicality is too problematic
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
Imagine Aristotle, whose metrics are different from Newton's, saying the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If I had Newton's metrics, then the laws would be Newtonian mechanics.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If I had Newton's metrics and I were to say, &quot;The laws are Newtonian mechanics&quot;, then my assertion would be true.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That is, (2) and (4) are <em>intuitively false</em>, but Metrics-Indexicality predicts that they are true. <strong>Note</strong>: The intended intuitive readings become obvious when you hold fixed the laws.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Relativity is too problematic
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
Our concept of lawhood is &quot;deeply related&quot; to modal, causal, and other philosophical concepts. If lawhood becomes relativized to languages or metrics, then the relativity may spread into other philosophical concepts, too.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Moreover, there will be normative conflicts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
How to align our credences
</li>
<li>
Which act to perform
</li>
<li>
Whether someone has a certain duty ...
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If we have to solve the above problems by relativising norms, then we might think it's too high a price to pay for holding a particular concept of lawhood.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Language-Rigidity is too problematic, but Metrics-Rigidity is more plausible
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
If we rigidify our actual language, then both path and future scientists are likely to get the laws wrong.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
That seems false, because we usualy think that future scientists are in a better position to get the laws right.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If we rigidify an ideal version of our language, then this account will have counterfactual component whose truth value needs to be evaluated using lawhood.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
But our job right now is to analyze lawhood in terms of the language. This make it <em>circular</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Metrics-Ridigity, accounrd to Eddon and Meacham, seems to be on firmer ground.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
While it's plausible that the language of the future scientific community will bear little resemblance to our current language, it's less plausible that the metrics of the future scientific community will bea little resemblance to our metrics of simplicity, informativeness, balance, etc. (bottom of pg. 17)
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
But why think that? Why think that the future metrics will be similar to our current metrics? Here are some potential reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Current metrics in science resemble all past metrics in science (Aristotle and Newton).
</li>
<li>
Current metrics in science resemble all past metrics in science since the Enlightenment (Verificationism).
</li>
<li>
We cannot conceive of a futre scientific community whose metrics bear little resemblance to current metrics in science. (If we are not supposing Metrics-Objectivity or some particular psychological facts about the members of the scientific community, how do we get this intuition?)
</li>
<li>
Current emtrics in science seem to be not for from the objectively right metrics. (But we are not supposing Metrics-Objectivity.)
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Another worry</strong>: There may not be a consensus on the current metrics in the scientific community. If we rigidify an ideal version of our current metrics, we will run into the circularity problem again.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>
What about Language-Salience
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
Language-Salience allows the candidate system to be formulated in any language, but it adds an extra component to the metrics, namely, salience.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When evaluating the candidate systems, we use the metrics of informativness, balance, and salience to pick out the best system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The best system will <em>come in its own language</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
According to Eddon and Meacham, <em>saliance</em> means usefulness, unity, and explantory power.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Presumably, they depend on certain psychological features of the assessors. This makes laws of nature depend on us.</p>
<ul>
<li>
They nothice this worry and reply that it depends on which answer to the Metrics question we pair it with.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Worry 1</strong>: Suppose we pair together the Language-Salience and Metrics-Rigidity. We rigidify our current metrics of salience.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
To be consistent, we should not appeal to any objective correctness of our current metrics.
</li>
<li>
<p>So it seems that the metrics of salience depends on us.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hence, best systemhood and lawhood also depend on us.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Worry 2</strong>: A deeper worry (also acknowledged) is about the notion of <em>salience itself</em>. It <em>seems less clear</em> than the notions of <em>simplicity</em> and <em>informativeness</em>, although we disagree about conceptions of those.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
So how to flesh out salience is an open question on this reduction.
</li>
<li>
At any rate, to keep the reductionist project consistent, fleshing out of these notions must avoid invoking naturalness, objectivity, or anything like that.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Extending the Account
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Eddon and Meacham proposed an analysis of lawhood without using naturalness. They would like to extend the proposal to other Lewisian analyses to alos avoid invoking perfectly natural properties. Here is their strategy:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>
Take the laws given by the system of true sentences that, given our present metrics, best balances simplicity, informativeness, and salience.
</li>
  <li>
Take all and only the properties deonoted by the predicates appearing in these laws. Call them <em>surrogate properties</em>.
</li>
  <li>
Wherever a Lewisian analysis invokes perfectly natural properties, subsitute these surrogates.
</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Lewisian analysis of duplication.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Original</em>: Two things are duplicates <em><abbr title="if and only if">iff</abbr></em> there is a bijection between their parts that preserves the perfectly natural properties and relations.
</li>
<li>
<em>Modified</em>: Two things are duplicates <em><abbr title="if and only if">iff</abbr></em> there is a bijection between their parts that preserves the surrogate properties and relations.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Eddon and Meacham try to handle three main worries.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>
A chaotic world
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
The <strong>argument</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
If the world is utterly chaotic, then there are no laws.
</li>
<li>
If there are no laws, then there are no surrogate properties.
</li>
<li>
If there are no surrogate properties, then the modification strategy does not work.
</li>
<li>
Therefore, if the world is utterly chaotic, then their strategy does not work.
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
The <strong>response</strong>: Their strategy takes the surrogates from the actual world; since the actual world is not so utterly chaotic, it works.
</p></li>
<li>
The <strong>worry</strong>: How do we know the actual world is not chaotic?
</li>
<li><p>
Perhaps a <strong>better reply</strong>: Why thing (1) is true?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Even if the world is utterly chaotic, there will be many truths about the world, such as the &quot;chaotic dynamics of the Universe.&quot;
</li>
<li><p>
These truths can figure into the system that best balances the relevant criteria of assesment.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
So there being no laws doesn't follow from there being much chaos.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Moreover, many chaotic systems display a great extent of order, which may be law-governed.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Surrogates are not all instrinsic
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Here is a locational property: <em>being two meters from an electron.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suppose it is in the best system, then some surrogates will be extrinisic. But in Lewis's system, natural properties are intrinsic. They <strong>reply</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
It is unlikely to appear in the actual best system. <em>Being two meters from an electron</em> is less salient than <em>being two meters from</em>. (But isn't it still extrinisic?)
</li>
<li>
We might be wrong about intrinsicality.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Foreign properties
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Surrogates are supposed to play the role of naturalness.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Possible there are foreign properties not instantiated at the actual world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
But surrogates are all from the actual world?
</li>
<li>
So there will be objective dissimilarity that cannot be analyzed by surrogates.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>
February 14th, 2014 <small>Seminar</small>
</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
Lewis has &quot;spatio-temporal&quot; manifolds, everything is determined by points in this (sometimes) perfectly natural properties.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;Intrinsic to the regions which they specify.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
For Lewis, the fundamental metaphysics of the world is determined by the decoration of the spatio-temporal manifold.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The laws are determined by what best specifies the manifold.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The best systemization is a language, whose predicates refer to the perfectly natural properties.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
You want to build a universe? Get a space-time manifold, get perfectly natural properties and decorate your manifold.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Problem</strong>: It is a possibility that there is a best systemization whose language's predicates do not refer to perfectly natural properties.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
In fact, if you compare it to the <abbr title="Best system account">BSA</abbr> with predicates that have perfectly natural properties, the system <em>without</em> it even looks better.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This seems opposed to Lewis' project, so:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Is it really a problem for Lewis?</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>Is there something within Lewis' overall view to deal with it?</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>Working out the alternative, you have to say something about what counts as laws.</em>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
There two ways of specifying what it takes for a world:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fundamental properties and space-time
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Just a world</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
Where it's the project of science to pick out what the fundamental structures of the world are.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Loewer on Similarity</strong>: Our notions about similarity are informed by properties which can be picked out by physics.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Semantics of &quot;Law&quot; and Laws
</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Daniel</strong>: This view is really useful when I'm doing this thing, and this other theory is useful when I'm doing this thing. Lets <em>roll with the relativism</em>.
</p>
  
<ul>
  <li><p>
<strong>Response</strong>: I <em>do not</em> want to go that way.
</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>
There has to be at least <em>really one</em> if we can &quot;pick our favorite.&quot;
</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>
<strong>Mike</strong>: This means laws will give you contradicting advice.
</p></li>
  <li>
<strong>Niko</strong>: I thought Daniel's worry was that the fundamentality is relativied to communities with interests. By picking a &quot;select&quot; community, you're not helping.
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Loewer</strong>: The word isn't realtivised to the community, it's that the very idea of scientific law is one in which the content is determined by the practice of our scientific community.
</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4>
What to take away
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Two pictures of fundamental properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Lewis picture: Epistemic worry, best theories which don't pick out single sets of laws.
</li>

<h3>
Armstrong's Critique of <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr>
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
He beats a horse he thinks he's killed.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Props up <em>Naive</em> <abbr title="Regularity theory">RT</abbr>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Armstrong is interested in:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;It is a law that Fs are Gs.&quot;
</li>
<li>
&quot;Fs make it <em>x</em> probable that Gs ...&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Assuming you have lawful generalizations, Armstrong thinks that the Humean account fails dreadfully.
</p></li>
<li><p>
His objections:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<abbr title="Humean uniformity">HU</abbr> that are not laws.
</li>
<li>
Laws that are not <abbr title="Humean unformities">HUs</abbr>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
&quot;Clearly this isn't right.&quot;
</p></li>
<li>
Armstrong thinks there are <em>vacuous</em> (uninstantiated) laws.
</li>
<li>
Armstrong also thinks that <abbr title="Humean uniformity">HU</abbr> is not necessary for lawhood.
</li>
<li>
Interested for methodological reasons.

<h4>
Background on Armstrong's theory of universals
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Armstrong appeals to a theory of universals he developers in his 1978 work <em>Universals and Scienctific Realism</em>. Different theories of universals will place different constraints on accounts of natural laws as relations between universals.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Principle of instantiation
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only real particulars have properties and relations, so only real particulars instantiate universals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Armstrong accepts actualism but rejects presentism. The real paticulars are actual entities from the past, present, and future. So accord to the principle of instantiation, there are no universals uninstantiated by actual things.
</li>
<li>
Principle of instantiation is supposed to be naturalistically motivated.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
For Armstrong, what the laws are in a world will depend on what universals are instantiated in that world. We'll return to this.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Principle of rejection of bare particulars
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Particulars (like universals) do not exist independantly of actual states of affairs.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
The bare particular and uninstantiated universal are &quot;vicious abstractions&quot; from states-of-affairs and are metaphysically impossible. Particularity and universality, however, are non-vicious
</li>
<li>
We determine the universals <em>a posteriori</em> &quot;on the basis of total science&quot; (pg. 83). If our final science involved laws with negative or disjunctive predicates, I suspect that Armstrong would say that it had failed to discover universals, (maybe that the science was the best we could do, but not ideal). He wants to be a full-fledged realist about universals.
</li>
<li>
Many general predicates do not express universal. For example, <em>being a game</em> probably doesn't express a universal because there is not something identical in all games that makes them games.
</li>
<li>
On Armstrong's view, there are no dijusctive or negative universals. But there are conjectuive universals. Conjuctionive universals, but not disjunctive or negative universals, can caputre the role that universals play in causal explanations and the sense in which all the particulars that instatiate a universal (roughly) must have something in common.
</li>
<li>
For Armstrong, a relation between universals holds always an everywhere within a world. It cannot happen that a universal <em>F</em> bears relation <em>R</em> to <em>G</em> at some time and places, but not others. That's because a universal is the same (identical) wherever/whenever it is instantiated; it is wholly present in its instantiations (pg. 79). However, universal will be related in different possible worlds.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Natural laws as necessitation relations between universals
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Armstrong offers the following account of natural laws:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It is a law of nature that Fs are Gs <abbr title="if and only if">iff</abbr> N(F, G).
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Fness and Gness are first-order universals.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
N is a second-order necessitation relation that holds between first-order universals.
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a relation of contingent rather than logical necessitation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
So N(F, G) symbolizes the state-of-affairs of the relation N holding between Fness and Gness.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
N(F, G) entails the state of the corresponding Humean uniformity, baring for now any <em>ceteris paribus</em> worries:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(N(F, G) \to (x)(Fx \supset Gx)\)</span>
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
But a stament of a Humean uniformity does not entail that the corresponding necessitation holds:
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(\lnot ((x)(Fx \supset Gx) \to N(F, G))\)</span>
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
&quot;<span class="math">\(\supset\)</span>&quot; is the material conditional. It is an important question what &quot;<span class="math">\(\to\)</span>&quot; symbolizes
</p></li>
<li><p>
Three worries about the entailment relation between N(F, G) and <span class="math">\((x)(Fx \supset Gx)\)</span> in 2.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>
David Lewis proposes the following <strong>dilemma</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>First horn</strong>: On one hand, the entailment might hold because because (2) would be better expressed by some other logical form. in that case, we could replace &quot;<span class="math">\(\to\)</span>&quot; with the material condition.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
For example, perhaps 2 should be expression as <span class="math">\((P \land Q) \to P\)</span>, where <em>P</em> is a statement of the Humean uniformity.
</li>
<li>
But then what is Q? Or perhaps the trugl logical form is <span class="math">\(P \to (O \lor Q)\)</span>. But it is unclear how to translate 2 into this form.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Second horn</strong>: If 2 is not better expressed by some other logical form, it seems that we must say that the entailment obtains in virtue of an <em>additional metaphysical necessity relation</em>, holding between <em>N(F, G)</em> and the Humean uniformity. But this new necessity relation is <em>mysterious</em>! Is it primitive or does it hold in virtue of something else?
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
One might also worry whether Armstrong's account is substantive. What is the necessitation relation besides that which is required to ensure uniformities, whatever &quot;ensure&quot; means?
</p></li>
<li>
<p>There are different kinds of uniformities;</p>
<ul>
<li>
It might be that all Fs are Gs, that not Fs are Gs, that if one kind of thing is an F, then another kind of thing is a G. How can N(F, G) explain diferent kinds of uniformities if N is a single relation?
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
In a way, these three worries are closely related. Armstrong hopes to appeal to the laws to explain the uniformities.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>But if the laws are to do this explanatory work, Amrstrong must say something infromative about how the laws &quot;produce&quot; or &quot;ensure&quot; that the unformities hold.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Much of the chapter concerns this
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Laws as first-irder universals
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Armstrong ultimately takes the necessiation relation (N) to be primitive.
</li>
<li><p>
Howver, he hopes that its primitiveness will be less mysterious if we think of N(F, G) not only as the state of affairs of necessitation relation holding between two universals, but also a complex, first order universal itself.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
He also hopes that treating N(F, G) as a universal will provide at least a partial solution to the entailment worry.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
What kind of think is N(F, G)?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
First, it is a second-order state of affairs. It involves first-order universals (Fness and Gness) falling under a second order
</li>
<li><p>
Armstrong holds that N(F, G) is also a cmoplex, <em>first-order</em> universal.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
In particular, it is a dyadic relation between first-order relation between first-order states of affairs. It is instantiated by positive instance of the law.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
An examples of a positive instance of the law,
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
(N(F, G))(<em>a</em>'s being F, <em>a</em>'s being G)
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
How is treating laws as first-order universal supposed to clairfy the relation between laws and uniformities?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Armstrong wants to assimilate the relation between laws and their positive instantiations. Thus, a Humean uniformity is the collection of all the positive instantiations of the corresponing law, understood as instantiations of a first-order universal.
</li>
<li>
Any mystery surrounding the instantiation relatino wouldn't be a problem facing Armstrong's thoeyr of laws <em>per se</em>. It would be a more general mystery facing realists about univerals.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Three potential difficulties:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
How illuminating is this solution? Do we now better understand the relationship between laws and uniformitites? The necessitation relation is still primitive.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;This reproach is just, I think, but the inexplicability of necessitation just has to be accepted&quot; because it is explanatorily indispendible (pg. 92).
</li>
<li>
But maybe we can still get an independent grasp on necessitation (next section). At this point, Armstrong still thinks he can say more about the entailment.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Is the solution <em>ad hoc</em>? Does treating laws of nature as first-order universals make other substantiated predictions? Is its sole motivation to allay the entailment worry?
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Armstrong suggests that treating laws as first-order universals explns in what sense laws are abstract.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Laws are abastractions because they are relations between universals, which themselves are abstract.
</li>
<li>
Universals are abstract, for Armstrong, because they obey the <em>principle of instantiation</em>, that is, they do not exit indendantly from actual states of affairs.
</li>
<li>
By holding that laws are first-order universals, Armstrong can explain what they are abstraction <em>from</em>: their positive instantiations.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The explanation depends on the controversial principle of instantiation, rejected by Platonists.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If we deny this principle, then we also deny that the abstractness of laws in Armstrong's sense is something that needs to be explained.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
It is logically kosher for N(F, G) to express both a state of affairs, which is well-formed by itself, and a universal, which requires arguments?
</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Singular causation, singular necessitation, and the &quot;independant fix&quot;
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Armstrong holds that purely singular causal connections are logically impossible.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Suppose it's <em>a</em>'s becoming F causes <em>b</em> to become G. Must this be an instance of some F to G law?
</li>
<li>
<p>For Armstrong, it is only an instance of an F to G law if <em>a</em>'s becoming G <em>in virtue of universals F and G</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
But it is logically possible that <em>a</em>'s becoming F causes <em>b</em> to become G not in veritue of the universals.
</li>
<li>
It ould just be a matter of this particular event causing that particular event.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Thus, purely singular necessitations are logically possible
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Causation cannot be indentified with necessitation because there are cases of necessitation that are not cases of causation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
But purely singular causation would be a case of purely singular necessitation.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
It is logically possible that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
It is not a law that Fs are Gs, and
</li>
<li>
<em>a</em>'s becoming F necessitates <em>a</em>'s becoming G and,
</li>
<li>
<em>b</em>'s becoming F necessitates <em>b</em>'s becoming H, (where being a G is incompatible with being an H, and <em>a</em> is not <em>b</em>).
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Armstrong suggests that we now have an indepedant grup on the necessitation relation and the mysterious entailment between laws and uniformities.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The necessitation relation is N(F, G) is the same as the necessitation relation operative in cases of singular necessitation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is the notion of singular necessitation more perspicuous than the notion of necessitation between universals?
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
It is clear then that <em>if such a relation holds between universals</em>, then it is automatic that each particular F determines that it is a G. That is just the instantiation of the universal N(F, G) is particulars cases. <strong>(pg. 97)</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
What role does singular necessitation play in this explanation? The key idea here seems to be that laws are first-order universals.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Some advantages and disadvantages of Armstrong's view
</h4>

<h5>
Difficulties
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
We want to admit that there are some uninstantiated natural laws. But if laws are relations between universals, and there are no universals that are uninstanted in the actual world, we might wonder how Amrstrong's view can accommodate uninstantiated laws.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Response</strong>: Strictly speaking, there are no uninstantiated laws, but we can ask what laws <em>would</em> hold in counterfactual situations.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
How will Armstrong's theory account for <strong>Smith's garden case</strong>?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: We will introduce <em>quasi-universals</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Being a fruit grown in Smith's garden. These are repeatable features of the world whose predicates involve esnetial reference to particulars.
</li>
<li>
<p>Armstrong's view mau be too permissive if necessitation relations between quasi-universals and universals count as natural laws.</p>
<ul>
<li>
He may only want to acknowledge those quasi-universals &quot;required for a law,&quot; but which ones are those?
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Advantages
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
We can appeal to the law N(F, G) to explain the existence of corresponding <strong>Humean uniformity</strong>. The naive regularity theory, by contrast, indentifies the law with the Humean uniformity and so cannot explain twhy the uniformity obtains.
</li>
<li><p>
Armstrong may have a way around the <strong>paradoxes of confirmation</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Armstrong suggests that an observation confirms a law that Fs are Gs <abbr title="if and only if">iff</abbr> the law explains the observation.
</li>
<li>
<p>Both F/Gs and non-F/non-Gs are explains by the law and so confirm the law, although the latter have less confirmatory strength than the former.</p>
<ul>
<li>
But non-F/Gs do not confirm the law, because their observation would not be explained by the law.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The laws as relations between universals account can explain why laws support counterfactuals. - When it is a lw that Fs are Gs, the necessiation relation between Fness and Gness ensures that, were <em>x</em> to be added to the calss of Fs, it would be a G (of necessity) - <strong>Caveat</strong>: The counterfactual is true <abbr title="if and only if">iff</abbr> the closest worl where <em>x</em> is F is not some distant world where the actual laws (and in particular the law that Fs are Gs) do not hold.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Armstrong's theory may be able to explain why inductive inference is rational.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Inductive inference from confirming instances to the laws is a species of <em>inference to the best explanation</em>.
