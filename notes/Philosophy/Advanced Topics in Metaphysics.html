<ul>
<li>People say that he is the major metaphysician of the 20th century.</li>
<li>Pretty standard view of metaphysics, trying to figure out what exists in a general way.</li>
<li>What exists &quot;is like.&quot;</li>
<li>What Aristotle was doing.</li>
<li>For Lewis, would could be and what is are very related.</li>
<li>He is most famous for his realism about possible worlds.</li>
<li>What makes something part of the same world?
<ul>
<li>Spatio-temporal relations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How are worlds specified? If you're making worlds, what're you doing?
<ul>
<li>You make a spatio-temporal manifold/structure.</li>
<li>You need to fill it up with perfectly natural properties in spots.</li>
<li>Natural properties and natural relations.</li>
<li>You can think of it as being &quot;decorated.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you're going to specify spatio-temporal structure, what're you going to do?
<ul>
<li>Points and metrics on the points.</li>
<li>People have thought about physics without points.</li>
<li>The more he says about possible worlds, the fewer possibilities there are.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Possible worlds have this structure of natural properties and particulars.
<ul>
<li>He thought natural properties were the job of physics.</li>
<li>What is it about the nature of physics that it's related to natural properties?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you made a gigantic list of things that exist, some of those things would be possible worlds.
<ul>
<li>What is it for one thing to be reduced to another?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Physics has the job of what is <em>actually instantiated</em>.
<ul>
<li>Mosaic of natural properties is what things actually reduced to.</li>
<li>Lewis' general metaphysics is a scientific metaphysics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In the philosophy community, the realism about possible worlds was greeted with &quot;incredulous stares.&quot;</p></li>
<li>We're interested in his views about &quot;nomological varieties.&quot;
<ul>
<li>We're interested in his account of laws, which is the Best Systems Account.</li>
<li>Which hinges on his account of objective chance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Objective probability is one of the must <em>useful</em> tools in the natural sciences, but we have no idea what it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He uses this account to give an account of counterfactuals, and these play a gigantically big role in his account of everything else.
<ul>
<li>Nelson Goodman, &quot;Fact, Fiction, or Forecast&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In showing that something is sufficient in trying to indentify the laws is by looking at instances, at their role.
<ul>
<li>This is a reductive enterprise.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-laws">On Laws</h3>
<ul>
<li>What was background for Prof. Loewer and what's background for us, those he's teaching, is different.
<ul>
<li>When he went to graduate school, the idea of thinking about the metaphysics of laws just wasn't there.</li>
<li>There were pragmatic or semantic accounts of laws, but about asking the general way of what it means to be law.</li>
<li>Philosophers were using &quot;law&quot; to explain what an event is.
<ul>
<li>He made use of the idea of law with reference to Goodman on laws.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The way that Lewis got people to think about metaphysics just wasn't on the table.</p></li>
<li>In recent times, &quot;What is a law?&quot; was put right on the table by Dretske and Armstrong in the 70s and 80s.
<ul>
<li>No one has written a history of the scientific account of laws.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hume thought that laws were sentences that applied in a certain way (pragmatic).</li>
<li>Ayer had a non-factual view.</li>
<li>Hempel and &quot;positive instances of a general law confirm it.&quot;</li>
<li><p>What are laws? They are of the form:</p>
<p>$$(x)(Fx \to Gx)$$</p>
<ul>
<li>If you open a textbook in classical or quantum mechanics, you will no longer see sentences of this form.</li>
<li>How damaging is this to their project?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Loewer's introduction to philosophy was when he was Amherst College and he wanted to date someone who thought a date was going to a talk by Max Black.</li>
<li>What is it to be &quot;law-like&quot; and what is the nature of law?</li>
<li>Hempel's paradox or the Raven paradox.
<ul>
<li>How do we understand &quot;confirms&quot;?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you have a paradox, you can say that a premise is bad, the reasoning form the premises is bad, or you accept the conclusion.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If something is worth doing, it's worth doing wrong the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>There's less than meets the eye to Goodman's paradox.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Laws are very special projections.</li>
<li>Later, many philosophers adopted Goodman's language.
<ul>
<li>A law is a generalation, but not any generalation.</li>
<li>Only predicates that pick out <em>natural properties</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There's a relationship of support between laws and counterfactuals.
<ul>
<li>This is <em>at least</em> epistemological because if we know the law, we know the counterfactual. But the truth of the counterfactual doesn't mean the law is true.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can a regularity explain anything?
<ul>
<li>This is the really err intution.</li>
<li>A regularity like all Fs are Gs.</li>
<li>A law explains <em>why</em> something is true.</li>
<li>Is the law doing the explaining?</li>
<li>It's certainly an idea that people like Dretske and Hempel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An explanation is a law along with an initial condition.</li>
<li>Armstrong thought that laws were some other part of reality, and they took from Goodman that the predicates must refer to certain kinds of properties.
<ul>
<li>Gru does not pick out a universal.</li>
<li>Does Armstrong think that Green is a universal?</li>
<li>A universal is supposed to, those features that are the things that have them are exactly similar to one another.</li>
<li>From the point of view of the science of color ...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For things to be an electron, it's a natural kind, universal.</li>
<li>An obvious consequence of the powers side is that if laws are things that cannot help but be instantiated.
<ul>
<li>All the people Loewer knows think that when there are these powers there are these metaphysical connections, if they don't hold this they have to explain what these connections are.</li>
<li>Metaphysically necessary connections.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shoemaker thinks that there is only one possible world -- this one.
<ul>
<li>All truths are necessary truths.</li>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;compulsory question&quot; for systematic philosophy: the question of one over many.
<ul>
<li>D.M. Armstrong thinks the answer is a theory of universals, but Lewis doesn't.</li>
<li>But universal <em>can</em> do other things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Although universals may be dispensible.</li>
<li>Lewis' ontology consists of <em>posibilia</em>.
<ul>
<li>Along with the &quot;iterative hierarchy of classes built upon them.&quot;</li>
<li>Properties are not much like universals, and they cannot do the work of universals.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Posibilia</dt>
<dd>Particular, individual things, some of which comprise our actual world and other of which are unactualised.
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Are universals better emplyed as a replacement for posibilia in Lewis' metaphysics?
<ul>
<li>Not to be considered in this paper.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the next section, Lewis will sketch Armstrong's theory of universals, constrasting them with properties understood as <em>classes of posibilia</em>.
<ul>
<li><p>Then, he will say why the &quot;One over Many&quot; argument is unconvincing.</p></li>
<li>Then, how universals help him in connection with the topics of:
<ul>
<li>Duplication</li>
<li>Supervenience</li>
<li>Divergent worlds</li>
<li>Minimal form for materialism</li>
<li>Laws and causation</li>
<li>Content of language and thought</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>And perhaps the list could be extended</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="universals-and-properties">Universals and Properties</h4>
<ul>
<li>Language offers several more or less interchangable words, that is &quot;universal&quot; and &quot;property&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;attribute&quot; ...
<ul>
<li>Also &quot;characteristic&quot; and &quot;kind&quot; and &quot;sort&quot; and &quot;type.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Universal</dt>
<dd><p>Those entities, if such there be, that mostly conform to Armstrong's account.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Property</dt>
<dd><p>Classes, any classes, but formemost classes of things.</p>
</dd>
<dd><p>To be a member of a class.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><em>Why call them <strong>properties</strong> as well as <strong>classes</strong>?</em>
<ul>
<li>They do not need to be classes of <em>actual</em> things.</li>
<li>The property of being a donkey is the class of <em>all</em> the donkeys.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Relation</dt>
<dd>Arbitrary classes of ordered pairs, triples, ... A relation among things is a property of tuples of things. With no restriction to actual things.
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Universals and properties are different in two ways.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Their instantiation
<ul>
<li>It is a contituent part of each particular that has it.</li>
<li>A property is &quot;spread around.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The property of being a donkey is partyly present wherever there is a donkey, in this or any other world. Far from the property being part of the donkey, it is closer to the truth to say that the donkey is part of the property. But the precise truth, rather, is that the donkey is a member of the property.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Thus universals would unify reality in a way that properties do not.</li>
<li>Things that share a universal have not just joined a single class. They literally have something in common. They are not entirely distinct. They overlap.</li>
<li>Universals defy intuitive principles. *The intuitions were made for particulars*.</li>
<li><em>Is copresense transitive?</em> <strong>No</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Round, silver, golden. Silver and round are copresent, for here is a silver coin. Golden and round are copresent, for there is a round coin; but silver and golden are no copresent.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Their abundance. This is the difference that qualifies for different work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal are sparse in Armstrong's work. *There are the universals that that there must be to ground the resemblences and causal powers of things, and there is no reason to believe in any more.* These would be rejected:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Not golden</li>
<li>Golden or wooden</li>
<li>Metallic</li>
<li>Self-identical</li>
<li>Owned by Fred</li>
<li>Belonging to class <em>C</em></li>
<li>Grue</li>
<li>First examined before 2000 A.D.</li>
<li>Being identical</li>
<li>Being alike in some respect</li>
<li>Being exactly alike</li>
<li>Being part of</li>
<li>Owning</li>
<li>Being paired with by some part in <em>R</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The world's universals should comprise of a minimal basis for characterizing the world completely.</li>
<li>Universals that do not contribute to this or are redundant are unwelcome.</li>
<li><em>A non-linguistic counterpart of a primitavely vocabulary for a language capable of describing the world exhaustively.</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Copresent</dt>
<dd>Two entities are <em>copresent</em> if both are wholly present at one position in space and time.
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>It is quite different for <em>properties</em>.
<ul>
<li>Any class of things, regardless of characteristic of the class, is a property.
<ul>
<li>So they are of immense abundance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>**There are so many properties that those specifiable in English, or in the brain's language of synaptic interconnections and neural spikes, could be only an infitesimal minority.**</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There so many properties that any two things share an infinite amount of properties and fail to share inifitely many as well.
<ul>
<li>This is so whether the two things are duplicates or utterly dissimilar.
<ul>
<li>Properties do not capture resemblence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Properties are causally irrelevant.</li>
<li>Properties &quot;carve reality at the joints.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Natural properties</dt>
<dd><p>Properties whose sharing makes for resemblance, and the ones relevant to causal powers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Perfectly natural properties</dt>
<dd><p>If the members of the class are all and only those things that share some one universal.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>An <em>adequate</em> theory of propeties is one that recognizes an objective difference between natural and unnatural properties.</li>
<li>A Nominalistic theory of properties could achieve adequacy by drawing primitive distinctions between particulars.</li>
<li>A Nominalist in pursuit of adequacy might prefer to rest with primitive objective resemblance among things.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Nominalism</dt>
<dd>the doctrine that universals or general ideas are mere names without any corresponding reality, and that only particular objects exist; properties, numbers, and sets are thought of as merely features of the way of considering the things that exist.
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>At this point, it could be a good idea to believe in universals *as well as* properties.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Properties have work of their own, and universals are ill-suited to do the work of properties.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider these sentences:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Red resembles organge more than it resembles blue.</li>
<li>Red is a color.</li>
<li>Humility is a virtue.</li>
<li>Redness is a sign of ripeness.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Prima facie</em>, these sentences contain names to denote individual things.</p></li>
<li>It is unlikely that there are universals for colors, especially particular colors.
<ul>
<li>Unless you subject the phrases to paraphrasing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Let <em>x</em> range over things, <em>P</em> over properties (classes) of things. Then:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\exist_1 P \Box \forall x (x \in P \equiv 0x)\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="one-over-many">One Over Many</h4>
<ul>
<li>Armstrong's main argument is the &quot;One over Many&quot; argument.
<ul>
<li>It is <em>because</em> that Lewis finds this unsatisfactory that he is seeking alternatives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An effort at systemic philosophy must give an account of purpoted fact.
<ul>
<li>There are three ways:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I deny it.</li>
<li>I analyse it thus ... .</li>
<li>I accept it as primitive.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Moorean fact</dt>
<dd>one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of any philosophical argument to the contrary
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>An adequate Nominalism is a theory that takes Moorean facts of apparent sameness of a type as primitive.
<ul>
<li>Universals are one possible solution, but not the only, and not even the best (?).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Early in <em>Universals</em> it &quot;undergoes an unfortunate double transformation.&quot;
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>analysandum</em> becomes the schema:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> has the property <em>F</em>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The turning point takes only two sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is [the Nominalist] to account for the apparent (if usually partial) identity of numerically different particulars? How can two different things both be white or both be on a table?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&quot;There are no universals but the proposition <em>a</em> is <em>F</em> is perfectly alright as it is.&quot; (Dodging the question.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Class Nominalism</strong> fails because it employs predications of class membership, which predications it cannot without circularity analyze in terms of class membership.</li>
<li><strong>Resemblance Nominalism</strong> fails to analyze predications of resemblance.</li>
<li>Predications of particpation evade analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="duplication-supervinience-and-divergent-worlds">Duplication, Supervinience, and Divergent Worlds</h4>
<ul>
<li>From now on, they'll only be natural, unnatural, or more-or-less natural properties.</li>
<li>Beginning the analysis with <em>duplication</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="duplication">Duplication</h5>
<dl>
<dt>Duplication</dt>
<dd><p>Ex, uing a copying machine. A perfect copier would make the two items the same in terms of atomic structure, making the two items, the copy and the original, indiscernible.</p>
</dd>
<dd><p>Two things are duplicates if and only if they have precisely the same intrinsic properties, however much their extrinisic properties might differ.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Intrinsic property</dt>
<dd><p>Property <em>P</em> is instrinsic if and only if, for any two duplicate things, not necessarily from the same world, either both have <em>P</em> or neither does.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Extrinsic property</dt>
<dd><p>Property <em>P</em> is extrinsic if and only in there is some such pair of duplicates of which one has <em>P</em> and the other lacks <em>P</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If we relied on physical theory to be accurate and exhaustive, we might define duplication in physical terms.
<ul>
<li>But this definition is no analysis because it presupposes the contigent physics of this actual world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Duplication is better analyzed in terms of <em>shared properties</em>.
<ul>
<li>To begin with <em>natural properties</em> and then move to <em>intrinsic properties</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If Materialism were false and physics an utter failures, as it is in some deplorable worlds, there would still be duplication in terms of <em>shared natural properties</em>.</p></li>
<li>All <em>perfectly natural properties</em> are <em>intrinsic properties</em>.
<ul>
<li>However, intrinsic properties can be disjunctive and miscellaneous and unnatural, so long as they never differ between duplicates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Duplication is important for two topics in metaphysics: supervenience and divergent worlds.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="supervenience">Supervenience</h5>
<ul>
<li>A supervenience thesis is a denial of indepedant variation.
<ul>
<li>It can be defined with <em>posibilia</em>.</li>
<li><p>To say that so-and-so supervenes on such-and-such is to stay there can be no idefference in respect to so-and-so without difference in respect to such-and-such.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beauty of statues supervenes on their shape, size, and colour, for instance, if no two statures, in the same or different worlds, ever differ in beauty without also differing in shape or size or colour.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A supervenience thesis is cautiously reductionist.</li>
<li>The worst that can happen is that an ascription of a supervenient property is equivilent to an uncountably infinite disjunction of maximally specfic descriptions of the other property.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Local duplicates</dt>
<dd>Two worlds are <em>local duplicates</em> just in case they are divisible into corresponding small parts in such that that: 1. Corresponding parts of the two worlds are duplicates, and 2. The correspondence preserves spatiotemporal relations.

<h5 id="divergent-worlds">Divergent worlds</h5>
<dl>
<dt>Diverge</dt>
<dd><p>Two possible worlds <em>diverage</em> just in case they are not duplicates but they do duplicate initial temporal segmant. For example, our world and another might match perfectly up through the year 1945, and go their separate ways thereafter.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Branching</dt>
<dd><p>Instead of duplicate segments, one and the same initial segment is allegedly share as a common part of two overlapping worlds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Determinism</dt>
<dd><p>A system of laws of nature is Determinsitic just in case no two divergent worlds both conform perfectly to the laws of that system.</p>
</dd>
<dd><p>A world is Deterministic just in case its laws comprise a Determinsitic system.</p>
</dd>
<dd><p>Determinism is the thesis that our world is Deterministic.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="minimal-materialism">Minimal Materialism</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is a difficulty in definining reductionist views as supervenience theses.
<ul>
<li>The solution is to employ <em>natural properties</em> not only by way of <em>duplication</em> but in a <em>more direct way</em> also.</li>
</ul></li>

<dd><p>The these that physics is a comprehensive theory of the world, complete as well as correct.</p>

<dd><p>Materialism is not a thesis of finite translatability of all our language into the language of physics.</p>
</dd>
<dd><p>Materialism is not to be indentified with any one Materialist theory of mind. It is a thesis that motivates a varity of theories of mind:</p>

<li>Behaviorism</li>
<li>Functionalism</li>
<li>The mind-body identity theory</li>
<li>Mind is a mistake</li>

<h4 id="the-importantance-of-our-topic">The importantance of our topic</h4>
<ul>
<li>The question, &quot;What is a law of nature&quot; is central to philosophy of science.
<ul>
<li>But also to epistemology and metaphysics.</li>
<li>In this section, Amstrong will establish why it's important both narrowly and broadly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Natural science has three tasks.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Geography and history of the universe.
<ul>
<li>Taking &quot;geography&quot; to cover space and &quot;history&quot; to cover time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discover what sorts of thing and what sorts of property there are in the universe and how they are constituted.</li>
<li>State the laws which the things in space and time obey.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It may not be obvious that there is a second task to be distinguished from the third.
<ul>
<li>Heat <em>is</em> molecular motion is not a historical or geographical truth.
<ul>
<li>This is not a law of nature or a &quot;bridge law&quot;</li>
<li>It is something different, a constituate of a property or range of properties in terms of more ultimate properties.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>These three inquiries are inextricably linked.
<ul>
<li>They can only be pursued in conjunction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If discovery of law is of the traditional tasks of natural science, then the nature of a law of nature must be a central ontological concern for philosophy of science.</li>
<li>The question of &quot;What is a law of nature?&quot; has a wider and philosophical importance.
<ul>
<li>The <em>only</em> relation that allows us to move from observed matters of fact to <em>unobserved</em> matters of fact is cause and effect.
<ul>
<li>Without this, we cannot move beyond observation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you appeal to Hume, you can say that inferences to particular unobserved phenomena would be unreliable without laws of nature.</li>
<li>But you don't have to.
<ul>
<li>The proposition is obvious enough in itself.</li>
<li>The scientist trying to establish the geography and history of the ubobserved universe must depends on laws.</li>
<li>When we make day-to-day inferences, it's not as important.
<ul>
<li>It's still irrational to make inferences without laws.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hume: &quot;Inference from the observed to the unobserved is central to our whole life as humans.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Without such laws, inferences would not be reliable.</li>
<li>Hence, important question for <em>epistemology</em>.</li>
<li>If so, we want to know about its <em>ontology</em>.
<ul>
<li>We will want to know what a law <em>is</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The view that would evade this arguments would the view that, &quot;althought there are regularities in the world, there are no laws of nature.&quot;
<ul>
<li>It &quot;denies that the world contains anything except these regularities.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Problem with this view: What reason we can to think the world is regular.
<ul>
<li>Problem of induction, too.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-possible-difficulty-in-investigating-our-topic">A possible difficulty in investigating our topic</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Paradox of Analysis</strong>: If we ask what sore of thing an X is then either we know what an X is or we do not. If we know, then there is no need to ask the question. If we do not, we have no way to begin the investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The solution? We have a fuzzy notion and we're reflecting on it.</li>
<li>If we can securely get instances of X, you can &quot;tie the inquiry down.&quot;
<ul>
<li>If we can be sure that an <em>a</em> is an X, then we can use other things which we know or believe about <em>a</em> to check the proposed account of X.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The Problem</strong>: There are no secure paradigms of laws of nature.
<ul>
<li>Consider contemporary natural science. It is perfectly epistemically possible that we dont know a single law of nature.
<ul>
<li>This may be the handicap to answering the question, of what is a law of nature.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even though we can point to no secure paradigm of laws, the scientific theories we now work with contain what at least some real laws of nature.
<ul>
<li>If our theories do no nearly grasp the truth, we would be unable to explain why so many predictions are succesful.</li>
<li>We do theoritical calculations allow us to get safely to and from the moon?
<ul>
<li>Can hardly be mere fantasy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can make an inference to the best explanation from the predicition success of contemporary science to the such theories have tolerable accuracy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even some pre-science laws are pretty good.
<ul>
<li>Consider these examples:
<ul>
<li>Fire burns</li>
<li>Bread nourishes</li>
<li>Water suffocates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If these were not true, then we would all be dead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This indicates the importance of fighting skepticism about this topic.
<ul>
<li>He considers this a <strong>reply</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The secone <strong>response</strong> to the objection is that we know the <em>forms</em> that the laws take.
<ul>
<li>Consider these forms that use dummies:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It is a law that Fs are Gs.</li>
<li>It is a law that an F has a certain probability of being a G.</li>
<li>It is a law that the quantities of P and Q co-vary in such a way that Q is certain functino of P (Q = f(P)).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>We can largely proceed with these schemata.
<ul>
<li>Philosophers cannot make any serious contribution to the <em>scientific</em> project of actually determining the laws.</li>
<li>To every subject, its appropriate level of abstraction.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If concrete examples are required, there are examples in current and earlier science.
<ul>
<li>Newton's Law is not <em>strictly</em> a law, but an approximation of a wide range of phenomena.</li>
<li>It makes for a good stand-in for a law of nature.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Regularities are the Realistic component of anti-Realist theories of laws.
<ul>
<li>As a result, a destructive critique of Regularity theory will undermine anti-Realist theories of laws.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Assumption</strong>: On Realism about universals.
<ul>
<li>Not even the Regularity theory can be developed without universals.</li>
<li>The Realist about laws who wishes to go beyond Regularity must use universals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Assumption</strong>: Actualism</li>
</ul>

<dd><p>We should not postualte any particulars except actual particulars, not any properties and relations save actual, or categorical, properties and relations.</p>

<li>This influence makes it powerful.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>He then argues that none of the judicious modifications in spirit of the theory are satisfactory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But the tactic can be generalized to RT in general, not just laws.</li>

<li><em>p</em> is [omnitemporally and omnispatially] true</li>
<li><em>p</em> is contigent</li>

<h4 id="classification-of-ciriticisms-of-the-rt">Classification of ciriticisms of the RT</h4>
<ul>
<li>If we take &quot;Humean uniformities&quot; and try to identify them with &quot;the laws of nature&quot;, difficulties of identification arise.
<ul>
<li>There are Humean uniformities that are not laws.
<ul>
<li>Being a Humean uniformity is not <em>sufficient</em> to be a law of nature.</li>
<li>There are laws that do not apply at all times, there are laws which are probabilistic.</li>
<li>So it's also not necessary that a law of nature be a Humean uniformity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even if these difficulties can be overcome, there are others.
<ul>
<li>It is a law that all Fs are Gs just in case all Fs are Gs where the latter is a Humean regularity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The &quot;intensional&quot; difficulties are in Chapter 4.</li>
<li>Chapter 5 will Chisolm until it is clear it's not worth it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="single-case-uniformities">Single-case uniformities</h4>
<ul>
<li>The laws of nature are, at best, a sub-class of the class of HUs.
<ul>
<li>A recognized research programme is finding a wa to cut out the unwanted HUs will remaining faithful to RT.</li>
<li>This first case is <em>against</em> Naive RT, which identifies laws and HU.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Probably, every object in the univers differs in its properties from every other object.
<ul>
<li>By this, general, non-local properties.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Living in Australia&quot; is not a property.</li>
<li>&quot;Being a light-second distant from proton A&quot; is not a general relation property.</li>
<li>&quot;Being a light-second distant from a proton&quot; would be satisfactory.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For each particular, therefore, it is likely that there exists at least one <em>individual conjunction</em> of properties, that is, a conjunction of properties.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-pass-from-single-case-uniformitie-ot-multi-case-uniformities">How to pass from single-case uniformitie ot multi-case uniformities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Given a plurality of single-case HU, we can immediately construct plural-case HU which have no reason to believe are manifestations of laws of nature.
<ul>
<li>Consider individuating conjuctions of properties A, B, and C associated with particulars <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>.
<ul>
<li>We can say that whenever an object is of the sort then it further has the property.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The problem of to exclude a disjunctive set of affairs is a close cousing to the problem introduced by Nelson Goodman with the predicates &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;bleen.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Suppose all things green turn blue after 2000, and all blue things green.</li>
<li>Rlative to the predicates &quot;green&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; all things change.</li>
<li>The problem is to say why one set of predicates should have preference over the other.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Regularity account of laws to be developed in a Realistic way must be stipulated that only certain non-local predicates can be used to state &quot;uniformities.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Admissible predicates must carve reality along some join, natural, unified, objectively resembling class of phenomena.
<ul>
<li>Otherwise these &quot;uniformities&quot; are not <em>uniformities</em>.</li>

There's one sense in which natural and non-natural if these notions get their content from the theories proposed, then there's a problem. Lewis places priority on natural properties and then includes it in his BSA, whereas others will use BSA to define the properties that are natural properties depending on the aims of science.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: On one view, we're chasing &quot;something out there.&quot; On another, what's natural is not out there. (...)</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Philosophers spend a lot of time convincing people that there's a problem, and the rest of their time convincing people there's no problem.</p>

<p>Instead of starting with the language of natural properties and the various systems formulated in this language, start with both languages and systems together and evaluate them together, the laws will be the best combination of language and systems. What counts as the language? A supervinience base for a lot else - and some other things.</p>
