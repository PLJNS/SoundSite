Topics in Philosophy of Psychology <small>with Professor Frances Egan</small>

Syllabus
</h2>

<h3>
Course Description
</h3>

<p>
The topic of the seminar is psychological explanation. We will focus on two issues: (1) The role of representation in psychological explanation, considering recent challenges – by (among others) proponents of extended, embodied, and enactive cognition – to the traditional view that psychological processes are to be understood as operations on symbol structures. We will consider the requirements for a theoretical construct to count as a representation, and whether there are any distinctively mental representations. (2) The relation of psychology to neuroscience, considering the recent challenge – by proponents of the so-called 'new mechanism' view in philosophy of science – to the view that psychological explanation of human cognitive capacities (in particular, computational explanations of cognitive capacities) can be constructed and confirmed independently of an account of how these capacities are realized in the brain. The new mechanists argue that genuine explanations of cognition are mechanistic explanations – they must bear a transparent relationship to accounts of realizing neural mechanisms.

Chapter 1 <small>The Persistence of Attitudes</small>
</h4>

<h5>
Introduction
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
Quotes <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> for an example of implicit, nondemonstrative, theoretical evidence.
</li>
<li><p>
Here is how the inference must have gone:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Hermia had reason to believe herself beloved of Lysander.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Because he told her.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If Lysander loves Hermia, then Lysander wishes Hermia well.
</p></li>
<li>
If Lysander wishes Hermia well, then Lysander does not voluntarily desert Hermia in the night in the woods.
</li>
<li>
But Hermia was deserted by Lysander.
</li>
<li>
Therefore, not voluntarily.
</li>
<li>
Therefore, it is plausible Lysander has come to harm, and plausibly by Demetrius's hands, for Demetrius is Lysander's rival for the love of Hermia.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Hermia believes (correctly) that: If <em>x</em> wants that <em>P</em>, and <em>x</em> believes that not-<em>P</em> unless <em>Q</em>, and <em>x</em> believes that <em>x</em> can bring about <em>Q</em>, then (ceteris paribus) <em>x</em> tries to being it about that <em>Q</em>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
But Hermia has it wrong about Demetrius.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The intricate theory that she relies on to make sense of her peers, that we rely on to make sense of Hermia, and what Shakespeare relies on to predict and manipulat our sympathies.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This theory, Fodor wants to emphasize:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
How often it goes right,
</li>
<li>
How deep it is,
</li>
<li>
How much we do depend on it.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h5>
How often it works
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
Applications of commonsense mediate our relations with one another, and when its predictions fail these relations break down.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Failures make for great theater.
</li>
<li>
Succeses are practically invisible and ubiquitous.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Commonsense psychology is like those mythical Rolls Royce cars whose engines are seals when they leave the factory.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Someone I don't know calls me and asks me to lecture in Arizone on Tuesday.
</li>
<li>
Fodor responds, &quot;Yes, thank, I'll be at your airport on the 3 p.m. flight.&quot;
</li>
<li>
<p>That's <em>all</em> that happens.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The theory is used to gap the bridge betwen utterances and actions.
</li>
<li>
If Fodor doesn't show it, the theory makes predicts about the likelihood of why.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The point is that the theory from which we get this extrodinary predictive power is just good old commonsense belief/desire psychology.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It tells us how to infer people's intentions from the sounds they make.
</li>
<li>
It tells us how to infer people's behavior from their intentions.
</li>
<li>
And all of this works on your friends and your spouses and absolute strangers.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
But what about all those ceteris paribuses?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Philosophers love the &quot;false or vacuous&quot; dilemma.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Consider the defeasibility of &quot;if someone utters the form of words, 'I'll be at your airport on the 3 p.m. flight,' then he intends to be at your aiport on the 3 p.m. flight.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
This generalization does <em>not</em> hold if:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The speaker is lying,
</li>
<li>
Monoligual speaker of Urdu who uttered by accident,
</li>
<li>
If the speaker is talking in his sleep,
</li>
<li>
Or ... whatever.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Perhaps all that this means with a <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause is, if it doesn't happen, then it still true because <em>ceteris paribus</em>.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A lot of philosophers are moved by this.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>But the predictions often come out true!</p>
<ul>
<li>
So how could it be <em>empty</em>?
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The reliance on uncashed <em>ceteris paribus</em> clauses is a general property of the <em>explicit</em> generalizations in <em>all</em> the special sciences.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
For example, &quot;A meandering river erodes its outside bank&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
False or vacuous a philosopher may complain.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause here cause &quot;If <em>p</em> then <em>q</em> unless not <em>p</em> then <em>q</em>.&quot;
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Something must have gone wrong, surely this explanation is meaningful despite the big <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Surely these statements are stronger than &quot;<em>P</em> in any world where not not-<em>P</em>.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
There is a face similarity between implicit generalizations and commonsense psychology and explicity generalization in special sciences.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We can get rid of the <em>ceteris paribus</em> clauses by <em>actually enumerating</em> the conditions.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
By this criterion, the only real science is basic physics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We can't enumarate all the conditions on geology by sticking to the vocabulary of geology.
</li>
<li>
The events in the <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause about the rivers aren't geological events, it's outside the domain. (Also hard.)
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Exceptions to generalizations of a special science are typically inexplicable from the point of view of that science.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is what makes it <em>special</em>.
</li>
<li>
<p>It's possible to enumerate them in the vocaubalry of another science.</p>
<ul>
<li>
You go &quot;down&quot; one or more levels and use the vocabulary of the more &quot;basic&quot; science.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If the world is describable at all in a closed causal system, it is with vocabulary of the most basic science.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
But the psychologist and the geologist needn't worry about this.
</li>
<li>
If you want to know where Fodor will be next Thursday, mechancins is <em>no use to you at all</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
The depth of the theory
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
It's tempting to think that commonsense psychology is a toolkit of truisms one learns on Granny's knee.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Like,
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The burnt child fears the fire.
</li>
<li>
Money cannot buy happiness.
</li>
<li>
Reinforcment affect response rate.
</li>
<li>
A way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
None of these are worth save, but commonsense psychology is not like this.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>There are two parts to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The theory's underlying generalizations are defined over unobservables.
</li>
<li>
They lead to its predictions by iterating and interacting rather than being directly instantiated.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Behavior is casued by mental states and this causation is intricate.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Roughly, <em>If x is y's rival, the x prefers y's discomfiture, all else being equal</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Doesn't mention behavior.
</li>
<li>
It <em>leads to</em> behvaioral predictions.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
It is a deep fact about the world that the most powerful etiological generalizations hold of unobservable causes.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Meterology is <em>not</em> deep because it's genralization are of the form, &quot;Red at night, sailors delight.&quot;
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychology <em>is</em> a deep theory, because we do not have access to mental states.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We're born mentalisms and realists, and we stay that way until common sense is driven out by bad philosophy.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Its indispensability
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
We have no alternative to the vocabulary of commonsense psychological explanation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
There is no other way of describing our behaviors and their causes if we want our behaviors and their causes to be subsumed by any counterfactual-supporting generalizations that we know about.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Without commonsense psychological generalizations, we cannot even describe the utterances as forms of words.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Word is a <em>psychological</em> category.
</li>
<li>
<p>There are non acoustic properties that all and only <em>fully intelligble</em> tokens of the same word type share.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Which is why our best technology cannot build a typewriter you can dictate to.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
We have <em>no</em> vocabulary for describing event types with these conditions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
My behvior in uttering, &quot;I'll be there on Thursday&quot; counts as an event of type <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
My arriving there on Thursday counts as an event of type <span class="math">\(T_j\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
'Events of type <span class="math">\(T_j\)</span> are consequent upon events of type <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span>' is even roughly true and counterfactual supporting.
</li>
<li>
Categories <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T_j\)</span> are other than irreducibly psychological.
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
Physics describes organisms <em>qua</em> motions, but not <em>qua</em> organismic.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It dissolves the behav<em>er</em> and the behav<em>ior</em> into atoms in the void.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Even if psychology was dispensible <em>in principle</em>, it's not argument for dispensing with it <em>in practice</em>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h6>
The essence of the attitudes
</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>
How do we tell whether a psychology <em>is</em> a belief/desire psychology? How, in general, do we know if propositional attitudes are among the entities that the ontology of a theory acknowledges? ... How do you distinguish elimination from reduction and reconstruction?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fodor will view psyhology as being commensensical about the attitudes just in case it postulates states satisfying:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Thy are semnatically evaluable.
</li>
<li>
The have causal powers.
</li>
<li>
The implicit generalizations of commonsense belief/desire psychology are largely true of them.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Squabbling about intuitions strikes me as vulgar.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h6>
<abbr title="Representational theory of mind">RTM</abbr>
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Thesis</strong>: We have no reason to doubt - indeed, we have substantial reason to believe - that it is possible to have a scientific psychology that vindicates commonsense belief/desire explanation.
</li>
<li>
Fodor will argue that the sorts of objections philosophers have recently raised against belief/desire explanation are not conclusive against the best vindicating theory currently available.
</li>
<li>
At the heart of <abbr title="Representational theory of mind">RTM</abbr> is the postulation of a <abbr title="Language of thought">LOT</abbr>, an infinite set of 'mental representations' which function both as immediate objects of propositional attitudes and as the domains of mental processes.
</li>
<li><p>
The two claims he's making:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
<strong>The nature of propositional attitudes</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For any organism <em>O</em>, and any attitude <em>A</em> towards the proposition <em>P</em>, there is a (computational/functional) relation <em>R</em> and a mental representation <em>MP</em> such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>MP</em> means that <em>P</em>.
</li>
<li>
<em>O</em> has <em>A</em> just in case <em>O</em> bears <em>R</em> to <em>MP</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>The nature of mental processes</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Mental processes are causal sequences of tokenings of mental representations.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
A train of thought is a causal sequence of tokenings of mental representations which express the propositions that are the objects of the thoughts.
</p></li>
<li>
<p><abbr title="Representational theory of mind">RTM</abbr> underlies practicaly all current psychological research on mentation, and the best science is ipso fact the best estimate of what there is and what it's made of.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Philosophers do not think this convincing, and Fodor is blushing for them.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
There is a stricking parallelism between the causal relations among mental states, on the one hand, and the semantic relations that hold among propositional objects, on the other.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Trains of thought are largely truth preserving<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;trick&quot; is to combine the postulation of mental representations with the &quot;computer metaphor.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Computers show us how to connect semantics with causal properties for symbols.</p>
<ul>
<li>
If having propositional attitude involves tokening a symbol, then we can get some leverage on connection semantical properties with causal ones for <em>thoughts</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h3>
On representation
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
Advanced &quot;beings&quot; like us have evolved with our environment, this is with representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
These somehow causally affect behavior.
</li>
<li>
This is an &quot;inference to the best explanation.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
To the degree which organisms can react to a changing circumstance causes the representation to change, and the changed representations change behavior.
</p></li>
<li>
Some people think that dynamic behavior requires representationalism.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Representation
</dt>
<dd>
A capacity of an organism.
</dd>

<dt>
Representation<em>s</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Concrete objects in the brain.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Some properties: - Physically realized. - They have causal powers, can have straightforward causal roles.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>They have content, they are meaningful.</p>
<ul>
<li>
This requires a distinction between a vehicle of representation, they thing physically realized.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
Vision resonates with the environment like a tuning fork. Gibson's theory of perception.
</li>
<li>
Our brains or us might have the structure for representations, but we can't &quot;poke at&quot; any representation.
</li>
<li><p>
One way that representat<em>ion</em> could get cached out is <em>dispositionally</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Some theories might posit capacities that are best characterized as <em>representational</em>.
</li>
<li>
<p>There might not be an isolable state at the computational level that's like, &quot;There's the representation!&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
A real property of an organism, but diffuse.
</li>
<li>
Like mass.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Many theories posit something analogous to &quot;sentences in the head.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>But there are other models of cognition.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Connectionist
</li>
<li>
Dynamical
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Vehicle-side
</h3>

<dl>
<dt>
Symbols
</dt>
<dd>
Little hooks on which you can hook meaning. Ripe for having content attributed to them, representation paradigmatically.
</dd>

<dt>
Connectionists models
</dt>
<dd>
Don't posit anything like &quot;sentences in the head.&quot; The carriers of meaning are networks of nodes that are connected in various ways. Do get interpreted, but do individual nodes get interpreted? <em>That</em> node refers to red <em>in a network</em>.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Typically are not construed as a strong representational view.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Dynamical models
</dt>
<dd>
Model the behavior of the system over time.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
What are the <em>vehicles</em> of meaning in non-symbol cognitive models?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Is there anything in here that could be plausible construed as a representation?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
In classical models, what the vehicles of representation are, symbols are hooks on which to hang interpretation. Waving red flags, interpret me.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Content-side
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
Content has satisfaction conditions.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The problem of intentionality: How do mental states <em>get</em> their meaning? What is it about mental representations that given them their meaning or content.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Public representation
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Public language content get their meaning by convention.
</li>
<li>
Icons and images get meaning by their resemblance and convention.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Private representation
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Some relation that isn't <em>already presuming</em> meaning or intentionality.
</li>
<li>
The &quot;meaning in the head&quot; or &quot;state of affairs&quot; which it representations, <strong>the naturalism semantics project</strong>.
</li>
<li>
&quot;Complex causal relations&quot; represented in my head.
</li>
<li>
Teleological function of the brain, dealing with objects and properties I'm used, and my ancestors are, used to.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
No one has be successful in naturalistic conditions on vehicle in the head having determinate content.
</p></li>
<li>
<p>One constraint on all of these account is that mental states can not only <em>represent</em> but also <em>mis</em>represent.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The contrast is with Grice's notion of natural meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The presence of smoke cannot misrepresent the presence of fire <em>unless</em> an agent misinterprets the smoke or something.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Strong representationalism
</h3>

<dl>
<dt>
Strong representationalism
</dt>
<dd>
Posits structure entities that have content.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Mental processes are defined over the structures.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
An important issue: is there anything in non-representational views that could count as a vehicle.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Extended cognition
</dt>
<dd>
The mind extends into the environment in some sense.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
The extended thesis is not centrally a critique of representationalism, but it does have theses that bring to bear on representationalism.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Embodied cognition
</dt>
<dd>
Human cognition is necessarily embedded, the mind-brain is the executive that controls the body.
</dd>

<dt>
Dynamical cognition
</dt>
<dd>
Cognition consists in a dynamical interaction between a subject and an environment, and it's wrong to characterize the interaction as contentful.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>
Jerry Fodor's &quot;Psychosemantics&quot;
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
He gives two arguments for the view known as &quot;representational theory of mind.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Folk psychology is indispendable.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The only way to vindicate it is if something like <abbr title="Representational theory of mind">RTM</abbr> is true.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Eliminativism would be an absolute disaster.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The second is the striking parrallelism between trains of thought and inferences.
</p></li>
<li>
The argument focuses on prediction, the only way to get around in the world is to ask someone something and predict that, in general, you do what you say and similar elsewhere.
</li>
<li>
Intentional realism is the only appropriate attitude to take towards folk psychology.
</li>
</ul>

There has to be a pretty good argument for the moving from property of one structure to the structure of the other. Specifically, they share semantics, but we need a good argument about syntax. Moving from the logical scheme to the empirical scheme.

Zenon Pylyshyn. &quot;The Explanatory Role of Representation&quot;
</h3>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The hardest puzzle is consciousness.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Second hardest is <em>meaning</em>, which this work explains.
</li>
<li>
Does <em>not</em> solve the puzzle of meaning.
</li>
<li>
The author aims to <strong>describe how the idea of the semantic content of representations is implicitly viewed within the field of cognitive science, and discuss why this view is justifiable</strong>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Representations
</dt>
<dd>
Generalizations stated over the contents of representations are not mere functional generalization in the usual sense.
</dd>

<dt>
Function generalizations
</dt>
<dd>
A theory that does not refer to physical properties of the particular system in question, only how it operates.
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
There will be a <em>representational level</em> and a <em>symbol-processing level</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
The Appeal to Representations
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Law-like generalization and explanations can differ in several ways, consider:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
A certain object accelerated at <em>a</em> meters per second per second because a steady force was applied that was equal to <em>ma</em>.
</li>
<li>
A certain neuron fired because a potential of <em>v</em> millivolts was applied along two of its sentries and that it had been inactive during the previous <em>t</em> milliseconds
</li>
<li>
A bit pattern of certain computer register came to have a particular configuration because of the particular contents present in the instruction register and the program counter, and because the system is wired according to a certain transfer protocol.
</li>
<li>
The computer printed numbers 2, 4, 6, because it started with the number 2 and added 2 repeatedly or because it applied the successor function repeatedly and double the value before printing.
</li>
<li>
The pedestrian dialed 911 because he believed it to be the emergency number and had recognized the urgent need for assistance.
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
Accounts (1), (2), and (3), all the terms refer to properties of objects within the closed system.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup>
</p></li>
<li>
Accounts (4) and (6) are different in this important respect: Both make substantive reference to entities or properties that are not an intrinsic part of their state description, that is <em>numbers</em> and <em>need for assistance</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
How is it possible for properties of the world to determine behavior when the properties are not causally related in the required sense to to the functional states of the system? --- <strong>Brentano's problem</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
The notion of representation is necessary only in the context of explanation.
</li>
<li>
Behavior is being caused by certain states of one's brain, and so mental states themselves are related to agent's actions.
</li>
<li><p>
Brain states are not causally connected in appropriate ways to walking or mountains.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The relationship <em>is one of content</em>, a semantic, not causal, relationship.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The notion of content is roughly that of what the states <em>are about</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Brain states cause certain movements. If these movements are view as members of equivalence classes described as &quot;writing a sentence about walking in the Santa Cruz mountains&quot; the brains states must be treated as embodying representations of these codes by certain rules.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Contrast the brain to a watch -- a watch's &quot;behavior&quot; is considered coextensive with the set of movements corresponding to the physical description of behavior.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Two ways of explaining human behavior capture extremely different generalizations.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Representational and Functional Levels
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
This shows that <strong>a <em>functional</em> description of mental processes is not enough, there must also be content</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
If the content makes a difference to behavior, is it not also a functional difference?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
To be in a certain representational state is to have a certain symbolic expression in some part of memory.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The expression <em>encodes</em> the semantic interpretation and the combinatorial structure of the expression encodes the relation among the contents of the subexpressions, much as in the combinatorial system of predicate calculus.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The reason there must be symbolic codes is that they can enter in causal relations.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup>
</p></li>
<li>
<p>If there is a unique symbolic expression corresponding to each content, one might expect functional states and representational states to once again be one-to-one relation. Not so, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
There may be codes with the same semantic content which are functionally but not semantically distinguishable.
</li>
<li>
<p>Merely possessing a certain symbolic expression that encodes semantic content is insufficient to produce behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>
You need to <em>interpret</em> the symbols.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Semantic-level generalization
</dt>
<dd>
Generalizations expressible in terms of the semantic content of representations.
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
Newell calls this &quot;knowledge-level.&quot;
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Symbol-level generalizations
</dt>
<dd>
Generalizations expressible in terms of functional properties of the functional architecture.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Representational Content as Defining a Level of Description
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
We abandoned a biological vocabulary because of arbitrarily large disjunctions corresponding to processes like &quot;thinking.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Functional generalizations cannot be captured in a finite neurophysiological description.
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a vocabulary in between &quot;<em>n</em> fired at <em>t</em> with <em>v</em>&quot; and &quot;He called 911 because he believed he was in an emergency.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
And it's <em>functional</em>.
</li>
<li>
And it's in <em>semantic terms</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
&quot;The principal of rationality is a major reason for our belief that a purely functional account will fail to capture certain generalizations, hence, that a distinct new level is required.&quot;
</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Levels and Constraints on Realizability
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For a description, that description might be compatible with other levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Newtons laws &quot;are compatible with&quot; biological taxonomy.

<h3>
Kirsh, &quot;When is Information Explicitly Represented?&quot;
</h3>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Computation is the process of making <em>ex</em>plicit what was <em>im</em>plicit.
</li>
<li>
We know what is explicit, the problem is what information is implicit.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Suppose</strong>: To understand a computation it is necessary to track the trajectory of informational state the computing system follows as it winds its way to an explicit answer.
</li>
<li><p>
Different kinds of computational mechanisms:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
PDP systems
</li>
<li>
Massive cellular automata
</li>
<li>
Analog relaxation systems
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
How far do you have to remove &quot;explicitness&quot; until it's implicit? That is, intuitively.
</p></li>
<li>
Suppose a system has highly ambigious encodings and must deliberate to choose the right interpretation.
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Computer and cognitive scientists talk as if they have a precise idea of these concepts (of implicit and explicit,) but that do not.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Intent</strong>: Articulate a particular conception of explicit information that at least may serve as a stable base for subsequent inquiries into the meaning of implicit information.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Will show why notions of explicit and implicit need elucidation, that they are not consistent.
</li>
<li>
Will explore efforts to identify explicit information with syntatically and semantically well-defined representations.
</li>
<li>
Will mention some implications of the view.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Our intuitions about explictness are inconsistent
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the intuition is that &quot;if it's there for all to see&quot;, then it's explicit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Four tempting properties of explicitness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Locality</strong>: They are visible structures with a definite defintion.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Movability</strong>: No matter where in a book a word is found or where in the library a book is stored, that word retains its meaning and retains its explicitness.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Meaning</strong>: Words have a definite information content.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Availability</strong>: The information content of a word is directly available to the system reading it, no elaborotate transition or interpretation process is necessary to extract the information it represents.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
The trouble with using immediate grapability, or better <em>immediate readability</em> as the mark of explicitness is that we run into problems as soon as we ask whether to count accessing time as part of the reading process.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
Are elements in large sets immediate readable?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This takes <em>computational energy</em> but is somehow <em>constant</em>/
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
From a process perspective information is explicit only when it is <em>ready to be used</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
No computation necessary.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Explicitness is tied to usability.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Our intuitions about implcitness are inconsistent
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Our concept of implicit runs into problems when we try to pin down what &quot;in principle, recoverable&quot; means.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Is it how much effort is required?
</li>
<li>
Our all lemmas, &quot;nearby&quot; or &quot;far&quot;, equally as implicit?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
To make it more natural, perhaps the conception of <em>that which is not explicit but which could be made so</em>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Why it matters whether our intuitions are unsetteled
</h4>

<h4>
Towards a theory of explicitness
</h4>

<h5>
Four condition on explicitness
</h5>

<dl>
<dt>
Locality
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
They states, structures, or processes - henceforth symbols - which explcitly encode information must be easily seperable from each other.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Movability
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
An ambigious language may explicitly encode information only if it is trivial to indetify the syntatic and semantic indentity of the symbol.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Immediately readable
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Symbols explicitly encode information if they are either: - Readable in constant time. - Sufficiently small to fall in the attention span of an operator.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>
Meaning
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The information which a symbol explictly encodes is given by the set of associated states, structures, or processes it activates in constant time.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Implications
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the following is false:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <abbr title="Language of thought">LOT</abbr> is the best level of analysis to represent perspicuously the episodes of in our <em>mental life</em>.
</li>
<li>
The events in our mental life are identical with operations on explicit representations.
</li>
<li>
The <abbr title="Language of thought">LOT</abbr> perspicously describes human information processing.

Eliminativism
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Unless there's a transparent relationship between folk psychology and scientific psychology, then the attitude to hold towards folk psychology is <em>elimination</em>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Ramsey still agrees with Fodor in <em>eliminativism</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stich, in the 80s and 90s, was an eliminativist.
</li>
<li>
Especially, &quot;The Case Against Belief&quot; didn't think there'd be a transparent relationship.
</li>
<li>
<p>Egan thinks there <em>both</em> wrong, that is the eliminativists.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The paper on this is &quot;Folk Psychology and Cognitive Architechure&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>
On Pylyshyn
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
He wants to justify and vindicate justification with regards to representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Why content?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The argument for a certain way of construing vehicles pervades the whole book.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>We cannot eliminate appeal to content</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Stich argued that if we really are symbol systems, like Fodor thinks, then why do we need content?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Pylyshyn is trying to justify the appeal to content.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
The First Puzzle
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Brain states are not causally connected to ...
</p>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;I believe there's beer in the refrigerator.&quot;
</li>
<li><p>
There's not causal connection between the object and my brain states.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
There <em>needn't</em> be a causal connection.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
I'm thinking about Paris and that might cause me to book a vacation to Paris.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The solution is how mental states fit into the physical world.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Why does he think we need content if it is the physical stuff that is realized?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Pylyshyn uses the capturing language as a way of &quot;getting the generalization.&quot;
</li>
<li>
<p>The difference between us and watches.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We get convinience from &quot;thermometer gets the tempurature.&quot;
</li>
<li>
We really need do need generalizations to explain our behavior, it's only convinient for everything else.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>
The Scheme
</h3>

<p>
<span class="math">\[ \lbrace I_1 ... I_n \rbrace \]</span> <span class="math">\[ f_I \]</span> <span class="math">\[ \lbrace S_1 ... S_n \rbrace \]</span> <span class="math">\[ f_R \]</span> <span class="math">\[ \lbrace P_1 ... P_n \rbrace \]</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The three levels:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Interpretations level
</li>
<li>
Interpretation function
</li>
<li>
Syntatitic level
</li>
<li><p>
Realization function
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Maps physical state to symbol (numeral) 2 or 3 ...
</li>
<li>
Nothing stops it from a bizzare representation.
</li>
<li>
Indepedant from meaning
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Physical states
</p>

<ul>
<li>
These have <em>many</em> causal functions.
</li>
<li>
These can bring about states, but those states can <em>bring about</em> cognitively important states.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
Fodor think that we need an <abbr title="Language of thought">LOT</abbr>, so he wants to identify a level where structures that function as words and they have <em>constituency relationships</em>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Niko</strong>: If you want to be representational about this, you can say that the mapping is just useful to us ...

<h3>
What's the role of content?
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the <em>I</em>s and the <em>P</em>s are in a one-one relationship, then you get not explanatory leverage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Why can't we just explain the systems behvior in terms of the causally efficacious states.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
What is implicit in this is not that there is a one-to-one function, but that there are arbitrarily many disjunctions
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
The rationality principle says that these transition states need to be <em>truth-preserving</em>.
</li>
<li><p>
There is an <em>implicit assumption</em> about explaining cognition that we are doing something inherently rational already.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Here's something that is paradigm of cognitive but not rational:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If we can succesfully characterize someone in this way, if they have the <em>p</em> and the <em>p</em> to <em>q</em>
</li>
<li>
These models are used to describe data that <em>is</em>. &quot;Cognitive function.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This kind of explantory projects is going to be applied to sub-cognitive functions and phenomena.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Not just the personal level of behavior.
</li>
<li>
Open up the principle of rationality
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Fodor in the appendix appeals to theory or processing, these theories are commited to mental representations, so this provides support for the <abbr title="Representational theory of mind">RTM</abbr> and by commitment the <abbr title="Language of thought">LOT</abbr>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A lot of these examples, the successes do not fit the model the content of attitudes, beliefs, desires.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Niko</strong>: Is the argument that you want to get rid of the interpretation level but that's silly because that's where we began to explain.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p>No, that's Prof. Egan's argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The argument <em>here</em> is that there's going to be a series of unprincipled generalizations without principles of rationality.
</li>
<li>
<p>These are understood as generalizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unless we can understand these truth-preserving.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Ben</strong>: Couldn't you weaken it, the more plausible claim is if we lose the generalizations, we lose these great explanations.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Derivability isn't a basic notion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We can reconstruct it to be truth preserving.

What goes on in the middle level, the higher-level causation.

</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Egan's View
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Unless what the system is doing is <em>recognizabily cognitive</em>, this isn't worth doing.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
It can add, it can compute, it can speak, it can see, it can recover the 3D structure of the scene.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
To do this, we need content.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Unless you can attribute content, you <em>can</em> talk about causal stories, you cannot explain Mary's <em>behavior</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The folk psychological explaination makes it rational.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This point will come up in Ramsey's <abbr title="Input-output">IO</abbr> representations.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Unless we can construe the inputs and outputs of the system, as cognitive function, then the project <em>doesn't make any sense.</em>
</li>
<li>
We're trying to explain a cognitive competence. We at least need to interpret the inputs and outputs of the system as contentful.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
On the third argument, pg. 27
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
My brain states are not causally connected to Paris, or walking, or mountains.
</li>
<li>
The relationship must be in terms in content.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
On Kirsch
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
The main point is that intuitions about explicitness and implicitness are very broken, but that does not stop philosophers and others from using these notions fairly heavily.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Our concept on explicit representation rests pretty heavily on the printed word.
</li>
<li>
<p>Construing explicit representation on the printed word, litterally sentences in the head, assumes that explicit representation can be understood in purely <em>functional</em> terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
The big point he wants to get across is that this has to come across in <em>procedural</em> terms.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
It's often assumed that we know what <em>explicit</em> is, but not what <em>implicit</em> is, and so implicit is defined in terms of not-explicit.
</p></li>
<li>
He distinguishes between <em>exploiting</em> regularities in the environment and <em>representing</em> regularities in the environment.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
On Marr
</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>
So why are we reading Marr? A lot of the work he's done has been falsified.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Not interested in the details, interested in the methodology
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Marr's Methodology
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
He thought that an account of a cognitive system has three different levels.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Those are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Theory of computation</strong>: Specification of the function computed. That is, the <em>what</em> that the system is doing. This is the level at which the competence of the system is, knowledge, processing details.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Representation &amp; Algorithm</strong>: This level specific the alogirthm which computes the function speficied in the theory of computation (level 1). And it specifies structures over which the alogirthm which it is defined. <em>Ex</em>. A function can be added, the algorithm can be Roman or Arabic.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Neural interpretation</strong>: This is, in some sense, the <em>how</em>.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The big picture:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Gray level array
</li>
<li>
Primal sketch
</li>
<li><p>
Has multiple:

<h3>
Ramsey, <em>Representation Reconsidered</em>
</h3>

<h4>
Section 1.2 <small>The job description challenge</small>
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Operating on the <strong>assumption</strong>: By reflecting a bit on ordinary notions of representation, we could gain a better understanding of what it is that scientists are referring to when they claim the brain uses such states.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Worry</strong>: Why need to look at commonsense notions of representation at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>
A theoretical notion is introduced in scientific theories in such a manner that give the posit its specific explantory role.
</li>
<li>
For example, position genens involes a specification of the diferent relations and causal roles that <em>we think</em> genes perform.
</li>
<li>
With this is mind, we go a look for the physical thing to fit the bill.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
For representation, things are not so simple.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We already have a notion of representation that is &quot;home&quot; in non-scientifc contexts, and this contrains what representation can qualify as representational.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Want</strong>: These notions of representation to provide a specification of the essential features of representation.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Want</strong>: A <em>job description</em> for representation like genes or protons have.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Problem</strong>: Our commonsense notions do not do this.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
These notions have core features and offer job descriptions representational states.
</li>
<li><p>
<strong>Problem <em>clearer</em></strong>: Stems from sort of features and roles that are associated with these notions.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The relevant roles include things like:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Informing
</li>
<li>
Denoting
</li>
<li>
Standing for something else
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
How are these suppose to be cashed out naturalistically.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Many scientific theories of the mind attempt to explain cognition in neurological or computaional terms. But our ordinary undersntadning of representation involves features and roles that can't be translated into such terms in any obvious way.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Consider our ordinary notions of mental representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Common sense understnading of beliefs, desires, and other folk-representational states assigns them some sort of &quot;underived or intrinsic intentionalality.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
Intentionality clearly isn't basic, functionally or causally.
</li>
<li>
So when we look at a system for these states, we don't really know what we're looking for.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A similar <strong>problem</strong> arises with regard to the commonsense understanding of non-mental representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Every day examples of non-mental represenatations, like:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Road signs
</li>
<li>
Pieces of written text,
</li>
<li>
Warning signs, so on
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
These all invole an <em>agents</em> who use the representations to stand for something else.
</p></li>
<li>
The folk notions of representations, therefore, will not suffice if transplanted directly into cognitive science.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Job description challenge
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
There needs to be some unique role or set of causal relations that warrants our saying some structure or states serves a representational function.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<blockquote>
  <p>
What might a successful job description for cognitive representation look like?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Depends on</strong>: What notion of representation we use.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Reductive theories cannot use representation as an explantory primitive.
</li>
<li>
If we understand processes as representational, then we need an account of representation in computational, mechanical, or causal physical terms.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Positing inner representations needs to include some sort of story about how the structure or state in question actually plays a representational role.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Analogy</strong>: Someone offers an account of some organic process, and the account needs a structure called a pump.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The advocate of this account would need to offer an explnanation of how this thing actually serves as a pump, as opposed to say a sponge.
</li>
<li>
And this explnanation will be a <em>functional</em> one.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cognitive researchers who invoke a notion of inner representation in their reductive accounts must provide some explanation of how the thing they positi serves as a representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is the <strong>problem of pan-representationalism</strong>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Goal</strong>: Argue that this hypothetical situation is in fact the actual sitation in a wide range of newer cognitive theories.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The meeting of the job description is not the same as providing a naturalistic account of content.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This would present the set of physical or causal conditions that ground the content of the representation.
</li>
<li><p>
Different version of naturalistic content:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Nomic dependency relations
</li>
<li>
Causal links to the world
</li>
<li>
Evolutionary function
</li>
<li>
Conceptual roles within a given system
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
These explain a certain <em>relation</em>, but not that relations <em>function</em> as a representation in a physical system.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Analogy</strong>: A compass.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
One type of question: How the compass actually functions as a representational device, how it informs a cognitive agent.
</li>
<li>
Another type of question: What conditions are responsible for the representational content of the compass.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Why this is pressing:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
&quot;Look, I'm not completely sure how state X comes to the content it has, but in my explanation of cogintive, there needs to be a state X that serves as a representation in the following way.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The <em>crux</em> of the job description challenge
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If conditions on representation are too strong, something &quot;left explained&quot;
</li>
<li>
If condition on represestation are too week, it's ambiguous and ubiquitous.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Millikan attempts to provide something that applies to mental and non-mental representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
To function as a representation is to be &quot;consumed&quot; by an interpreter that treats the state in question as indicating some condition.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Fine for non-mental.
</li>
<li>
Unclear for mental, consumption <em>inside</em> a system.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This account is &quot;under-reduced.&quot;
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Dretske, as it will be shown, over-redcuded.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Intutively, his conditions have nothing to do with representation at all.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
It may seem impossible to meet the job description challenge, but no, certain theories in the CCTC paradigm have done it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Claim</strong>:the difference between the two corresponds to the division classical theories of computation and non-classical accounts of cognition.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Job description challenge, <em>improved</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
There are two parts:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Is it possible to describe physical or computational processes in representational terms?
</li>
<li>
Is it absolutely necessary to describe physical or computational processes in representational terms?
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Even a rock can be described as acting on the belief that it needs to sit very still.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
The reason this fails is because the notion of representation is too weak.
</li>
<li>
In the &quot;other way&quot;, we can described biological systems <em>in terms of</em> molecules and toms, it is nevery <em>necessary</em> to invoke representational langauge in theory characterization of a representational syste,
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Job Description Challenge, <em>improved ... again </em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Three questions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Is there some explanotory benefit in described an internal elements of a physical or computational process in representational terms?
</li>
<li>
Is there an element of a proposed process or architecture that is functioning as a representation in a sufficienitly robust or recognizable manner, and if so, how does it doe this?
</li>
<li>
Given that theory X invokes internal representations in its account of process Y, are the internal states playing this sort of role, and if so, how?
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, &quot;explanatory benefit&quot; and &quot;sufficiently robust&quot; are not as robust as we would like.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Requires a &quot;judgement call.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Section 3.1 <small>IO-representation</small>
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Previously</strong>: Marr's model of cognitive science involved three level of
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
The top level involved the specification of a function that defines the sort of cognitive capacity we want explained.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
Consider again a simple operation like multiplication. Although we say various mechanical devices do multiplication, the transformation of numbers into products is something that, strictly speaking, no physical system could ever do. Numbers and products are abstract entities, and physical systems can't perform operations on abstract entities. So at the algorithmic level we positi symbolic representations of numbers as inputs to the system and symbolic representations of products as outputs. We re-define the task of multiplication as the task of transforming numerals of one sort into numerals of another sort.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The input to a cognitive system: say, &quot;faces&quot;.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The output of a cognitive system: say, &quot;That's so-and-so.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
How do <abbr title="Input-output">IO</abbr>-representation concerns meet the job description challenge? <strong>Two responses</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
<strong>Avoid</strong> the question altogether. &quot;Outside the domain of cogntive theorizing.&quot;<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We're actual in the business <em>of explaing the porcesses and operations that convert input representations into output representations</em><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Say</strong>: Minds do certain things, and one of the main things they do is &quot;perform cogitive tasks properly described as types of representations.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It is a <em>fact of nature</em>.

<strong>Challenge</strong>: If the CCTC is a theory that invokes <em>real</em> representations, then it needs objectively realy representations.
</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response</strong>: They <em>are</em> real, and here's why.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's a sense in which most things are <em>observer-dependant</em>.</p>

It's always possible to view a system as a series of interacting atoms.

Review of RR <small>by Mark Sprevak</small>
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Structure of Ramsey's <em>negative</em> argument</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Argue that in order for something to be an <em>X</em>, it must satisfy a description <em>D</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is the <em>job description</em> or <em>minimal conditions for representation</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Argue that to the best of our knowledge, nothing satisfies <em>D</em>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;How do our best psychological theories use the notion of representation?&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Conclude that since nothing satifies <em>D</em>, there are no <em>X</em>s.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Ramsey finds all theories unsatisfactory, there are no representations.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
On step 1:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
For a state to be a representation:
</p>

<ol>
<li><dl>
<dt>
Non-derived intentionality
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Be capable of having original intentional content.
</p>
</dd>

</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
On step 2:
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>
The <strong>exception</strong>: <abbr title="Classicaly computational theory of cognition">CCTV</abbr>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><abbr title="Classicaly computational theory of cognition">CCTV</abbr> is commited to representation in 2 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<abbr title="Input-output">IO</abbr>-representation
</li>
<li>
S-representations
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
On <abbr title="Input-output">IO</abbr>-representation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Representations are needed as the gross-inputs and outputs of cognitive agents.
</li>
<li>
But also the steps of a computation need representations, so internal representations.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
On S-representation
</p>

<ul>

CCTC is commited to positive interinal representations. (I'm not sure why this or if this is bad?)

Structure for motion
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
The visual system is able to recover the 3D dimension of a scene with on 2D input.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Some of the sources of information:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stereoptics</strong>: The visual system uses disparity to get a vantage point on a scene.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Motion</strong>: Relative motion, what the visual system gets is a series of images that are different in certain respects. A series of retinal images.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
One thing that Ullman and Hildreth point out is that there are an infinite number of 3D representations out of any 2D input.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The visual system is aided by physical constraints and assumptions.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The relevant assumption for this mechanism: <em>rigitidy</em>.
</p></li>
</ul>

Rigidity

<p>
Objects in the environment when they're moving is that they are solids.

&quot;[T]hey assume that if it is possible to interpret the changing 2-D images as the projection of a rigid 3-D object in motion, then such an interpretation should be chosen.&quot;

<abbr title="Structure for motion">SFM</abbr> Theorem

<dd>
<p>
Three distinct views of 4 non-coplanar points is sufficient to determine a rigid configuration for the points.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you see the object long enough and in good enough conditions, then when the <abbr title="Structure for motion">SFM</abbr> theorem is saying is that there is <em>only one</em> rigid configuration of points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
There's a lot more non-rigid configuration, but <em>assuming rigidity</em>, it is much easier to compute a representation. That is, there are less configurations.
</li>
</ul></li>

An organism that <abbr title="Structure for motion">SFM</abbr> with minimum input will react to the world better than an organism that does not have <abbr title="Structure for motion">SFM</abbr>, rigidity, etc. More plausible for this reason?
</li>
<li><p>
If an object is getting bigger with regards to a visual field, what are the possible interpretations?

It's getting <em>bigger</em>.

It's getting <em>closer</em>.

<em>Exploits</em> regularities but doesn't <em>represent</em> regularities.

We can <em>count</em> it as <em>innate knowledge</em> <em>if we want</em>, but it isn't explicitly represented and almost certainly not <em>explicitly</em> represented.

The environment can be exploited without be represented.

<blockquote>
  <p>
What is it for a state in the head to be a representation?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
Couple of things to distinguish:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
As a question &quot;what it is for a thing in the head to have meaning or conent? What is it to have content? What determines contents of internal representations?&quot; <em>Problem of intentionality side</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The answer for <em>external</em> representations is convention, we agree on meanings for items in the language.
</li>
<li>
This cannot be the answer for <em>internal</em> representation.
</li>
<li>
Cannot specificy little &quot;agents in the head.&quot; Because regress? No agents.
</li>
<li>
There's going to be a naturalistic account of how internal structures and states, naturalistic hope, relation between states and structures in the head and the objects in the world.
</li>
<li>
To say that it's naturalistic is to discount, say, semantic relations.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Personal and sub-personal processes.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Like a map, people use maps, we use them to navigate, etc.
</li>
<li>
This kind of answer isn't going to work for mental interpretations.
</li>
<li>
When theories posit these states or structures, it's only appropriate to think of these, they're not used by <em>people</em>, it's a category mistake to think of Prof. Egan as <em>using</em> the primal sketch to navigate the world, it's her <em>system</em> that uses the primal sketch.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Ben</strong>: I don't see any <em>job</em> for it to do. What he said led me to believe that it not a necessary condition on representation that is has semantic content.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This is a <em>possibility</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
A theory might posit a symbol structure
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
What Ramsey is thinking about is being a representation and not about what it is to have content.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Remember the distinction between <em>personal</em> and <em>sub-personal</em> representation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is it for a physical thing to represent another?</p>
<ul>
<li>
It should be used in a characteristcally representational way. <em>Useless</em>.
</li>
<li>
Content is in som way relevant to how it functions, or it's effects. So the representation is causally efficacious, causes effects in cognition, and the content is relevant to those effect <em>in some way</em>, I say in <em>in some way</em> because it isn't at all clear how
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Egan</strong>: Content is a way of summarizes what is <em>causally relevant</em> or the <em>causal</em> role of a belief<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
Dretske, on the other hand, thinks that content has to get its hands on the wheel.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This can't be right, content is not driving the car.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
It cannot be a consequence of doing that job that too many thing count as as representational.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The theorizing we're doing do no presuppose propositional attitudes or representational capacities.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A theory that is doing this may <em>under-explain</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If you describe cognition in terms of atoms, quarks, molecules, ...
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is <em>over-explaining</em>.
</li>
<li>
<p>It's damning to say, &quot;Hey, where is the intentionality?&quot;</p>

Not a theoretically useful notion.

<li>
Spell out the basic idea of receptor representation.
</li>
<li>
Will <strong>ask</strong> how well this notion fares with regard to the job description challenge.
</li>
<li>
Will <strong>show</strong>: Dretske's own account of representation overlaps a great deal with the receptor notion, yet is more sophiticated and robust.
</li>
<li>
Will <strong>argue</strong>: Neither representation nor misrepresneetation is without serioues flaw.
</li>
<li>
The receptor notion should be abandoned.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>
The receptor notion
</h4>

<dl>
<dt>
Receptor notion
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Because a given neural or computational structure is regularly and reliably activated by some distal condition, it should be regarded as having the role of representation (indicating, signaling) that condition.
</p>

<p>
Such structures are viewed as representations <em>because</em> of the way they are triggered to go into particular states by other conditions.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>
<em>Example</em>: Certain neurons should be viewed as &quot;detectors&quot; <em>precisely because</em> they reliably respond to certain stimuli.
</p>

<p>
Just a though a frog has &quot;convexity detectors&quot; in their brain.
</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<blockquote>
  <p>
[I]f a cell is claimed to represent a face, then it is necessary to show that it fires at a certain rate nearly every time a face is present and only very rarely reaches that rate at other times.
</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li><p>
The receptor notion of representation is found in connectionist models in the similarity of &quot;internal units&quot; to &quot;neural receptors&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
It's suggested they provide a more representational role than computational symbols.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Three examples of the receptor notion in simple organisms:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Certain neurons in a bugs brain.
</li>
<li>
&quot;Face cells&quot; in monkeys
</li>
<li>
Magnetosomes &quot;compass-like&quot; represenetation which tell where to go.
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
Whatever the state is that the so called receptor brings about, it is &quot;viewed as having the role of representing the external condition because of this causual or nomic dependency relation.&quot;
</p></li>
<li>
<p>Philosophers have developed a notion &quot;natural meaning&quot; or &quot;information content&quot; that supposedly results from the way a state reliably co-varies with some other state of affairs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
This makes people say &quot;<em>this</em> smoke <em>means</em> <em>that</em> fire.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
The receptor notion and the job description challenge
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
The reception notion faces a <em>prima facie</em> difficulty:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Problem</strong>: The reception notion does not provide an account that reveals <em>why</em> a given state or structure should be seen as serving as a representation.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Counterexample</strong>: There are several <em>non-representational</em> internal states that must in their proper functioning reliably covary with various states of affairs. For instnace, <em>our immunse system consistently reacts to infectious insults to our body</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Fix</strong>: While nomic dependency may be an important <em>element</em> of representation, it is not <em>sufficient</em> to be representation.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This <strong>problem</strong> leads to a <strong>dilemma</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If to serve as a representation <em>just is</em> to serve as a state that reliably responds, then you get overly reduced accounts of representation that lead to <em>pan-representationalism</em> because of the immune-system objection.
</li>
<li>
Or, if to serve as representation includes factors that go substantially beyond the mere fact that they reliably respond to specific stimuli, then we have no clear sense of how states reliably responding to certain stimuli are supposed to function as representations.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This is closely related to the problem of <em>pansemanticism</em>, that is that &quot;meaning is just about <em>everywhere</em>&quot; and &quot;is a natural conclusion to draw from informational analyses of content.&quot;
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Dretske to the rescue?
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Dretske offers an ambitious account of mental represnetation that is designed to be naturalistic about content, and show how content can produce behavior.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What's wrong with Dretske's account will be illuminating with regaurds to a fundamental problem for the receptor notion of representation <em>in general</em>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Central to the account is the notion of <strong>indication</strong>, a relation based on law-like dependency.
</p></li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
Indication
</dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>
For condition <em>C</em> to indicate another condition <em>F</em>, <em>C</em> must stand in relation to <em>F</em> characterized by subjunctives like the following: If <em>F</em> had not occured, <em>C</em> would not have occured.
</dd>
</dl>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Already saw</strong>: that mere nomic dependency is insufficient to bestow full-blown representational status on cognitive structures.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is the <strong>disjunction problem</strong>, that concerns the difficulty in account for misrepresentation when a state's content is based upon the way it is triggered by distal conditions.
</li>
<li>
The <strong>response</strong> to this: &quot;the core of any thoery of representation must contains an explanation of how misrepresentation can occur.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The <strong>response</strong> is to offer teleological components, placing tighter restrictions on the sort of causal relations that matter.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Dretske</strong>: Internal indicators are mental representations when they are recruited as a cause of certain motor output <em>because of</em> their relevant nomic dependancies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
This does two things for Dretske:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
Enables him to handle the problem of misrepresentation
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Error is no possible because we can say that whenever an indicator is triggered by something other than what it was <em>supposed to</em> indicate.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Gives him a way of showing how informational content can be explanatorily relevant.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Structures are recruited as causes to motor output <em>because</em> they indicate certain conditions.
</li>
<li>
Being an indicator is a causally relevant feature of a strcture, so being a type of <em>meaning</em> is causally relevant.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Dretske</strong>: To serve as a representation is necessarilly to:
</p>
  
<ol>
  <li>
Stand in some sort of nomic dependancy relation to some distal state of affairs
</li>
  <li>
Becoming incorporated into the processing <em>because</em> of this dependancy, thereby acquiring the function of indicating those states of affairs.
</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h5>
Does Dretske's account of representation function help?
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Dretske is committed to</strong>: <em>If</em> neural structures are actually recruited as causes of bug-catching movements because they are reliably caused to fire by the presence of bugs, <em>then</em> it certainly seems tempting to assume that they are serves as &quot;bug representations.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Question</strong>: Does this arragment suffice for representation?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
To answer, distinguish between:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The puraly causal/physical or nomic dependencies that are thought to &quot;underlie&quot; the indication relation
</li>
<li>
The quasi-semantic, information relation often said to be &quot;carried by&quot; these dependancies.
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
If <em>A</em> carries information about <em>B</em>, (1) is this supposed to be distinct from <em>A</em>'s being nomically dependant on <em>B</em>? (2) Or are those claims indentical?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
On (1), the infromation carried by <em>A</em> is somehow seperate and distinc from properities of <em>A</em>. It <em>A</em> carries information about <em>B</em>, it does so whether or not anyone exploits it.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
This is <strong>ambigous</strong>, refering to either:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The non-semantic nomic depancy
</li>
<li>
Something more semantically charged, like information
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
This is the <em>realist interpretation of information and indication</em>.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
On (2), it's unambigous. This is the <em>deflationary interpretation of information and indication</em>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The <strong>central problem</strong>: Dretske's account of representation appears to assume that if a given structures is incorporated into a system's processing because it nomically depends on a certain state of affairs, it automatically follows that it being used to stand for that state of affairs.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This <strong>unsupported</strong> and <strong>almost certainly false</strong>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Counterexample to (1)</strong>: The firing pin in a gun similarly bridges a causal gap between the pulling of the trigger and the discharge of the round. It also serves to reliably mediate between two distinct states of affairs – to reliably go into a specific state when and only when a certain condition obtains. However, no one thinks the firing pin serves as some sort of representational device.
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Counter example to (2)</strong>: For example, if A is always larger than B, then, in the deflationary sense we are now using the term, A carries information about the size of B; that is, the size of A could be used to tell someone something about the size of B. If A is heavier than B, or if A is always within a certain distance of B, then the weight or position of A can serve to inform a cognitive agent about the weight or position of B. In all of these cases, specific types of law-like relations between two objects (larger than, heavier than, close to, etc.) can and sometimes are exploited by cognitive systems like ourselves such that our knowledge of the status of one of the objects can generate knowledge of the status of the other one as well. When this happens, one of the objects is serving as a type of representational device.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If we equate <em>being an indicator</em> to <em>being a nomic dependant</em>, then Dretske cannot establish that a strcture is a representation by showing that it functions as an indicator because, <em>trivially</em>, functioning as an indicator just means functioning as a nomic dependant</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>And</strong>: There are all sorts of ways to function as a nomic dependant without being a representation.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Further dimensions of the receptor notion
</h4>

<h4>
Does it really matter?
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
People often compain that Ramsey is just being stingy with the word &quot;representation.&quot;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Why not treat receptor states as some low-level type of representation?
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Taken as a point about langauge and our ability to call things what we want, it's correct, but silly.
</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>
<strong>Question</strong>: If we <em>are</em> so inclined, and nothing is really at stake, then why not go ahead and do so?
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Answer</strong>: There's a fair bit at stake.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
&quot;Representation&quot; and &quot;information&quot; is increasingly just being use to mean &quot;reactive neuron&quot; or &quot;causal activity.&quot;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Here he paints a picture about a real-world case where misconceptions about representation derailed progressed and blurred understanding in a study by Freeman and Skarda.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Summary
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Argued</strong>: One of the most popular ways of thinking about representation in cognitive science is confused and should be discontinued.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Receptor notions of representation have jobs that have little to do with representation.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
In an effort to supplment the failure, Ramsey brought in Dretske.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Dretske focused on on an indication <em>functioning</em> as a representation.
</li>
<li>
<p>He suggest that receptor type states qualify as representation by virtue of the way in which they are incorporated into cognitive architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>But</strong> the functional role is a reliable causal mediator, and not a representation.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If the receptor notions of representation are in fact the right account of representation in connectionism, then <abbr title="Representational theory of mind">RTM</abbr> is simply false.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Commentary
</h3>

<p>
I want to be a realist about the external world and I have this premonition without proof that my inner representation of the external world reliably covaries with at least those states important for my continued success. If the way I characterize this inner representation is with &quot;indication&quot; and Ramsey's argument that indication isn't represnetation, then I reject indication as being able to tell the whole story about representations in the head.
</p>

<p>
A way that I think indication could be vindicated is by making it a part of inner representation instead of claiming that it's all there is. For instance, perhaps my vision is an indication of what's directly in front of my eyes, my ears indicate what sounds are in my immediate surroundings, etc, and these indications are amalgamated by my mind in higher-order mental processing, and it is from this and these indications that an internal representation emerges.

What <em>I</em> want to know is can the cognitive scientist take a cognizers utterance of some state, say &quot;I am hungry&quot;, and use folk psychology to say that the utterance is a represents the utterer's inner state, and if you look at the inner state you'll find the processes by which the brain finds out and stores facts about the body (but more generally the non-mind world). <a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

There's a paradox of analysis here. Where on one hand, cogntive theorists and any competent user of English knows what a representation <em>is</em>, we use them all the time. There are only two possibilities: We know what representation is or we do not. If we do, then we need to &quot;check what's in the head&quot; and see if it's a representation. If we don't, what's the use of writing a book on it? To clarify what we could possibly mean by a &quot;mental model&quot; or &quot;mental representation&quot;? We don't know what representation is <em>in general</em>, nevermind whether they can be in the head. <a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

There is no &quot;primtive&quot;, I think, in geometry. A point can be expressed in terms of a line or a plain. A line can be expressed in terms of two points or a part of a plain. A plain can be expressed in terms of 3 lines or 3 points. <a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

I think that this may relate to debates in epistemology about brains in vats. So, here's an argument for thinking that they are related issues, and then I'll give an additional argument for how one might give insight to the other.
</p>

<p>
Assume that the brain represents its environment. Cummins thinks that a representation can represent all content with which it is isomorphic. Ramsey thinks that the content that matters is what <em>this</em> brain is using <em>now</em>. What's at issue in brain-in-vat skeptical arguments is that the brain's internal representation is isomorphic with both what the realist wants to call objective reality and what the skeptic wants to call &quot;brain-in-vat land&quot; (or the images that the vat is giving the brain or something). What's problematic about the brain-in-vat skeptical concerns is that the internal represnetation is isomorophic with both pictures.

So how is this insightful? Well. Actually. In hindsight, I'm not sure, I'd have to think about it. I think this succesfully relates the issues. Ramsey's solution to BIV challenges might be that the most explantory useful theory, because objective reality is what <em>this</em> brain is using <em>now</em> or something ... <a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>

It's not that we don't know what representation is or that there is no representation, but rather, it's that representation with regards to cognizing if a fuzzy and poorly understood. <a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref">↩</a>
