<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>The topic of the seminar is psychological explanation. We will focus on two issues: (1) The role of representation in psychological explanation, considering recent challenges – by (among others) proponents of extended, embodied, and enactive cognition – to the traditional view that psychological processes are to be understood as operations on symbol structures. We will consider the requirements for a theoretical construct to count as a representation, and whether there are any distinctively mental representations. (2) The relation of psychology to neuroscience, considering the recent challenge – by proponents of the so-called 'new mechanism' view in philosophy of science – to the view that psychological explanation of human cognitive capacities (in particular, computational explanations of cognitive capacities) can be constructed and confirmed independently of an account of how these capacities are realized in the brain. The new mechanists argue that genuine explanations of cognition are mechanistic explanations – they must bear a transparent relationship to accounts of realizing neural mechanisms.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-1-the-persistence-of-attitudes">Chapter 1 <small>The Persistence of Attitudes</small></h4>
<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<ul>
<li>Quotes <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> for an example of implicit, nondemonstrative, theoretical evidence.</li>
<li>Here is how the inference must have gone:
<ul>
<li>Hermia had reason to believe herself beloved of Lysander.
<ul>
<li>Because he told her.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If Lysander loves Hermia, then Lysander wishes Hermia well.</li>
<li>If Lysander wishes Hermia well, then Lysander does not voluntarily desert Hermia in the night in the woods.</li>
<li>But Hermia was deserted by Lysander.</li>
<li>Therefore, not voluntarily.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is plausible Lysander has come to harm, and plausibly by Demetrius's hands, for Demetrius is Lysander's rival for the love of Hermia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hermia believes (correctly) that: If <em>x</em> wants that <em>P</em>, and <em>x</em> believes that not-<em>P</em> unless <em>Q</em>, and <em>x</em> believes that <em>x</em> can bring about <em>Q</em>, then (ceteris paribus) <em>x</em> tries to being it about that <em>Q</em>.</li>
<li>But Hermia has it wrong about Demetrius.
<ul>
<li>The intricate theory that she relies on to make sense of her peers, that we rely on to make sense of Hermia, and what Shakespeare relies on to predict and manipulat our sympathies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This theory, Fodor wants to emphasize:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How often it goes right,</li>
<li>How deep it is,</li>
<li>How much we do depend on it.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-often-it-works">How often it works</h5>
<ul>
<li>Applications of commonsense mediate our relations with one another, and when its predictions fail these relations break down.
<ul>
<li>Failures make for great theater.</li>
<li>Succeses are practically invisible and ubiquitous.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Commonsense psychology is like those mythical Rolls Royce cars whose engines are seals when they leave the factory.
<ul>
<li>Someone I don't know calls me and asks me to lecture in Arizone on Tuesday.</li>
<li>Fodor responds, &quot;Yes, thank, I'll be at your airport on the 3 p.m. flight.&quot;</li>
<li>That's <em>all</em> that happens.
<ul>
<li>The theory is used to gap the bridge betwen utterances and actions.</li>
<li>If Fodor doesn't show it, the theory makes predicts about the likelihood of why.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The point is that the theory from which we get this extrodinary predictive power is just good old commonsense belief/desire psychology.
<ul>
<li>It tells us how to infer people's intentions from the sounds they make.</li>
<li>It tells us how to infer people's behavior from their intentions.</li>
<li>And all of this works on your friends and your spouses and absolute strangers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But what about all those ceteris paribuses?
<ul>
<li>Philosophers love the &quot;false or vacuous&quot; dilemma.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider the defeasibility of &quot;if someone utters the form of words, 'I'll be at your airport on the 3 p.m. flight,' then he intends to be at your aiport on the 3 p.m. flight.&quot;
<ul>
<li>This generalization does <em>not</em> hold if:
<ul>
<li>The speaker is lying,</li>
<li>Monoligual speaker of Urdu who uttered by accident,</li>
<li>If the speaker is talking in his sleep,</li>
<li>Or ... whatever.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perhaps all that this means with a <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause is, if it doesn't happen, then it still true because <em>ceteris paribus</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A lot of philosophers are moved by this.
<ul>
<li>But the predictions often come out true!
<ul>
<li>So how could it be <em>empty</em>?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The reliance on uncashed <em>ceteris paribus</em> clauses is a general property of the <em>explicit</em> generalizations in <em>all</em> the special sciences.
<ul>
<li>For example, &quot;A meandering river erodes its outside bank&quot;
<ul>
<li>False or vacuous a philosopher may complain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause here cause &quot;If <em>p</em> then <em>q</em> unless not <em>p</em> then <em>q</em>.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Something must have gone wrong, surely this explanation is meaningful despite the big <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause.
<ul>
<li>Surely these statements are stronger than &quot;<em>P</em> in any world where not not-<em>P</em>.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is a face similarity between implicit generalizations and commonsense psychology and explicity generalization in special sciences.
<ul>
<li>We can get rid of the <em>ceteris paribus</em> clauses by <em>actually enumerating</em> the conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By this criterion, the only real science is basic physics.
<ul>
<li>We can't enumarate all the conditions on geology by sticking to the vocabulary of geology.</li>
<li>The events in the <em>ceteris paribus</em> clause about the rivers aren't geological events, it's outside the domain. (Also hard.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exceptions to generalizations of a special science are typically inexplicable from the point of view of that science.
<ul>
<li>This is what makes it <em>special</em>.</li>
<li>It's possible to enumerate them in the vocaubalry of another science.
<ul>
<li>You go &quot;down&quot; one or more levels and use the vocabulary of the more &quot;basic&quot; science.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the world is describable at all in a closed causal system, it is with vocabulary of the most basic science.
<ul>
<li>But the psychologist and the geologist needn't worry about this.</li>
<li>If you want to know where Fodor will be next Thursday, mechancins is <em>no use to you at all</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="the-depth-of-the-theory">The depth of the theory</h5>
<ul>
<li>It's tempting to think that commonsense psychology is a toolkit of truisms one learns on Granny's knee.
<ul>
<li>Like,
<ul>
<li>The burnt child fears the fire.</li>
<li>Money cannot buy happiness.</li>
<li>Reinforcment affect response rate.</li>
<li>A way to a man's heart is through his stomach.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>None of these are worth save, but commonsense psychology is not like this.</li>
<li>There are two parts to this:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The theory's underlying generalizations are defined over unobservables.</li>
<li>They lead to its predictions by iterating and interacting rather than being directly instantiated.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Behavior is casued by mental states and this causation is intricate.
<ul>
<li>Roughly, <em>If x is y's rival, the x prefers y's discomfiture, all else being equal</em>.
<ul>
<li>Doesn't mention behavior.</li>
<li>It <em>leads to</em> behvaioral predictions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is a deep fact about the world that the most powerful etiological generalizations hold of unobservable causes.
<ul>
<li>Meterology is <em>not</em> deep because it's genralization are of the form, &quot;Red at night, sailors delight.&quot;</li>
<li>Psychology <em>is</em> a deep theory, because we do not have access to mental states.
<ul>
<li>We're born mentalisms and realists, and we stay that way until common sense is driven out by bad philosophy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="its-indispensability">Its indispensability</h5>
<ul>
<li>We have no alternative to the vocabulary of commonsense psychological explanation.
<ul>
<li>There is no other way of describing our behaviors and their causes if we want our behaviors and their causes to be subsumed by any counterfactual-supporting generalizations that we know about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Without commonsense psychological generalizations, we cannot even describe the utterances as forms of words.
<ul>
<li>Word is a <em>psychological</em> category.</li>
<li>There are non acoustic properties that all and only <em>fully intelligble</em> tokens of the same word type share.
<ul>
<li>Which is why our best technology cannot build a typewriter you can dictate to.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We have <em>no</em> vocabulary for describing event types with these conditions:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>My behvior in uttering, &quot;I'll be there on Thursday&quot; counts as an event of type <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span>.</li>
<li>My arriving there on Thursday counts as an event of type <span class="math">\(T_j\)</span>.</li>
<li>'Events of type <span class="math">\(T_j\)</span> are consequent upon events of type <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span>' is even roughly true and counterfactual supporting.</li>
<li>Categories <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T_j\)</span> are other than irreducibly psychological.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Physics describes organisms <em>qua</em> motions, but not <em>qua</em> organismic.
<ul>
<li>It dissolves the behav<em>er</em> and the behav<em>ior</em> into atoms in the void.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even if psychology was dispensible <em>in principle</em>, it's not argument for dispensing with it <em>in practice</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="the-essence-of-the-attitudes">The essence of the attitudes</h6>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we tell whether a psychology <em>is</em> a belief/desire psychology? How, in general, do we know if propositional attitudes are among the entities that the ontology of a theory acknowledges? ... How do you distinguish elimination from reduction and reconstruction?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fodor will view psyhology as being commensensical about the attitudes just in case it postulates states satisfying:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Thy are semnatically evaluable.</li>
<li>The have causal powers.</li>
<li>The implicit generalizations of commonsense belief/desire psychology are largely true of them.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Squabbling about intuitions strikes me as vulgar.</p>
</blockquote>
<h6 id="rtm">RTM</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis</strong>: We have no reason to doubt - indeed, we have substantial reason to believe - that it is possible to have a scientific psychology that vindicates commonsense belief/desire explanation.</li>
<li>Fodor will argue that the sorts of objections philosophers have recently raised against belief/desire explanation are not conclusive against the best vindicating theory currently available.</li>
<li>At the heart of RTM is the postulation of a LOT, an infinite set of 'mental representations' which function both as immediate objects of propositional attitudes and as the domains of mental processes.</li>
<li>The two claims he's making:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>The nature of propositional attitudes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For any organism <em>O</em>, and any attitude <em>A</em> towards the proposition <em>P</em>, there is a (computational/functional) relation <em>R</em> and a mental representation <em>MP</em> such that:
<ul>
<li><em>MP</em> means that <em>P</em>.</li>
<li><em>O</em> has <em>A</em> just in case <em>O</em> bears <em>R</em> to <em>MP</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The nature of mental processes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Mental processes are causal sequences of tokenings of mental representations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>A train of thought is a causal sequence of tokenings of mental representations which express the propositions that are the objects of the thoughts.</li>
<li>RTM underlies practicaly all current psychological research on mentation, and the best science is ipso fact the best estimate of what there is and what it's made of.
<ul>
<li>Philosophers do not think this convincing, and Fodor is blushing for them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a stricking parallelism between the causal relations among mental states, on the one hand, and the semantic relations that hold among propositional objects, on the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Trains of thought are largely truth preserving<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>The &quot;trick&quot; is to combine the postulation of mental representations with the &quot;computer metaphor.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Computers show us how to connect semantics with causal properties for symbols.
<ul>
<li>If having propositional attitude involves tokening a symbol, then we can get some leverage on connection semantical properties with causal ones for <em>thoughts</em>.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>He gives two arguments for the view known as &quot;representational theory of mind.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Folk psychology is indispendable.
<ul>
<li>The only way to vindicate it is if something like RTM is true.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eliminativism would be an absolute disaster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The second is the striking parrallelism between trains of thought and inferences.</li>
<li>The argument focuses on prediction, the only way to get around in the world is to ask someone something and predict that, in general, you do what you say and similar elsewhere.</li>
<li>Intentional realism is the only appropriate attitude to take towards folk psychology.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Intentional realism</dt>
<dd><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<ul>
<li>There's a big project on mental logic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Oftentimes, people's reason doesn't follow logic.
<ul>
<li>People will more often affirm the consequent, more common in mental reasoning than <em>modus tollens</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;I believe there is beer in the refridgerator.&quot;

<li>What was causally efficaious was that I wanted beer and believed there was beer, so I got up to get beer.</li>
<li>This is the &quot;belief box.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There has to be a pretty good argument for the moving from property of one structure to the structure of the other. Specifically, they share semantics, but we need a good argument about syntax. Moving from the logical scheme to the empirical scheme.

<h4 id="the-appeal-to-representations">The Appeal to Representations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Law-like generalization and explanations can differ in several ways, consider:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A certain object accelerated at <em>a</em> meters per second per second because a steady force was applied that was equal to <em>ma</em>.</li>
<li>A certain neuron fired because a potential of <em>v</em> millivolts was applied along two of its sentries and that it had been inactive during the previous <em>t</em> milliseconds</li>
<li>A bit pattern of certain computer register came to have a particular configuration because of the particular contents present in the instruction register and the program counter, and because the system is wired according to a certain transfer protocol.</li>
<li>The computer printed numbers 2, 4, 6, because it started with the number 2 and added 2 repeatedly or because it applied the successor function repeatedly and double the value before printing.</li>
<li>The pedestrian dialed 911 because he believed it to be the emergency number and had recognized the urgent need for assistance.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Accounts (1), (2), and (3), all the terms refer to properties of objects within the closed system.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Accounts (4) and (6) are different in this important respect: Both make substantive reference to entities or properties that are not an intrinsic part of their state description, that is <em>numbers</em> and <em>need for assistance</em>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>How is it possible for properties of the world to determine behavior when the properties are not causally related in the required sense to to the functional states of the system? --- <strong>Brentano's problem</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The notion of representation is necessary only in the context of explanation.</li>
<li>Behavior is being caused by certain states of one's brain, and so mental states themselves are related to agent's actions.</li>
<li>Brain states are not causally connected in appropriate ways to walking or mountains.
<ul>
<li>The relationship <em>is one of content</em>, a semantic, not causal, relationship.
<ul>
<li>The notion of content is roughly that of what the states <em>are about</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Brain states cause certain movements. If these movements are view as members of equivalence classes described as &quot;writing a sentence about walking in the Santa Cruz mountains&quot; the brains states must be treated as embodying representations of these codes by certain rules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contrast the brain to a watch -- a watch's &quot;behavior&quot; is considered coextensive with the set of movements corresponding to the physical description of behavior.
<ul>
<li>Two ways of explaining human behavior capture extremely different generalizations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="representational-and-functional-levels">Representational and Functional Levels</h4>
<ul>
<li>This shows that <strong>a <em>functional</em> description of mental processes is not enough, there must also be content</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the content makes a difference to behavior, is it not also a functional difference?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To be in a certain representational state is to have a certain symbolic expression in some part of memory.
<ul>
<li>The expression <em>encodes</em> the semantic interpretation and the combinatorial structure of the expression encodes the relation among the contents of the subexpressions, much as in the combinatorial system of predicate calculus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The reason there must be symbolic codes is that they can enter in causal relations.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></li>
<li>If there is a unique symbolic expression corresponding to each content, one might expect functional states and representational states to once again be one-to-one relation. Not so, because:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There may be codes with the same semantic content which are functionally but not semantically distinguishable.</li>
<li>Merely possessing a certain symbolic expression that encodes semantic content is insufficient to produce behavior.

<li>Functional generalizations cannot be captured in a finite neurophysiological description.</li>
<li>There is a vocabulary in between &quot;<em>n</em> fired at <em>t</em> with <em>v</em>&quot; and &quot;He called 911 because he believed he was in an emergency.&quot;

<h4 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Computation is the process of making <em>ex</em>plicit what was <em>im</em>plicit.</li>
<li>We know what is explicit, the problem is what information is implicit.</li>
<li><strong>Suppose</strong>: To understand a computation it is necessary to track the trajectory of informational state the computing system follows as it winds its way to an explicit answer.</li>
<li>Different kinds of computational mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>PDP systems</li>
<li>Massive cellular automata</li>
<li>Analog relaxation systems</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How far do you have to remove &quot;explicitness&quot; until it's implicit? That is, intuitively.</li>
<li>Suppose a system has highly ambigious encodings and must deliberate to choose the right interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer and cognitive scientists talk as if they have a precise idea of these concepts (of implicit and explicit,) but that do not.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intent</strong>: Articulate a particular conception of explicit information that at least may serve as a stable base for subsequent inquiries into the meaning of implicit information.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Will show why notions of explicit and implicit need elucidation, that they are not consistent.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="our-intuitions-about-explictness-are-inconsistent">Our intuitions about explictness are inconsistent</h4>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the intuition is that &quot;if it's there for all to see&quot;, then it's explicit.
<ul>
<li>Four tempting properties of explicitness:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Locality</strong>: They are visible structures with a definite defintion.</li>
<li><strong>Movability</strong>: No matter where in a book a word is found or where in the library a book is stored, that word retains its meaning and retains its explicitness.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning</strong>: Words have a definite information content.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: The information content of a word is directly available to the system reading it, no elaborotate transition or interpretation process is necessary to extract the information it represents.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The trouble with using immediate grapability, or better <em>immediate readability</em> as the mark of explicitness is that we run into problems as soon as we ask whether to count accessing time as part of the reading process.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Are elements in large sets immediate readable?
<ul>
<li>This takes <em>computational energy</em> but is somehow <em>constant</em>/</li>
</ul></li>
<li>From a process perspective information is explicit only when it is <em>ready to be used</em>
