Section 1 - Sets
</h3>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Sets are collections of objects
</li>
<li>
Sets are used to group objects together
</li>
<li>
<strong>Set</strong>: A <em>set</em> is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its <em>elements</em>. We write <span class="math">\(a \in A\)</span> to denote that a is an element of the set <strong>A</strong>. The notation <span class="math">\(a \in  A\)</span> denotes that a is not an element of the set <strong>A</strong>.
</li>
<li><p>
Conventional sets:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> = 0,1,2,3,..., the set of natural numbers;
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> = ...,−2,−1,0,1,2,..., the set of integers;
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}+\)</span> = 1, 2, 3, . . ., the set of positive integers;
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> = p/q:|: p Z, q Z, and q = 0, the set of rational numbers;
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{R},\)</span> the set of real numbers;
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}+\)</span>, the set of positive real numbers;
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, the set of complex numbers;
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Datatypes in computer science are built upon the concept of a set. Interestingly, boolean values are all subsets of <span class="math">\(\lbrace 0, 1\rbrace \)</span>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Empty Set
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The empty set is a special set which is a set containing no elements. Denoted by either <span class="math">\(\emptyset \)</span> or <span class="math">\(\lbrace \rbrace \)</span>, but not <span class="math">\(\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \)</span>, which is a set containing the empty set, which would be <span class="math">\(\lbrace \lbrace \rbrace \rbrace \)</span>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A Singleton Set
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Singleton sets contain one element, for instance <span class="math">\(\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \)</span>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Subsets
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Subset</strong>: The set A is a subset of B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B. We use the notation A B to indicate that A is a subset of the set B.
</li>
<li><p>
The quantification for the sets A and B, a being a subset of B, is <span class="math">\(\forall x(x \in  A \to  x \in  B)\)</span>. This translates to &quot;For all <span class="math">\(x\)</span> it is true that if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is an element in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is an element in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Some conditions for proving subset relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li>
To show that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, show that if x belongs to A then x also belongs to B.
</li>
<li>
To show that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is not a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, find a single <span class="math">\(x \in  A\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is not an element in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<em>Theorem</em>: For every set <span class="math">\(S\)</span>,<span class="math">\(\emptyset  \subseteq  S\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S \subseteq  S\)</span>.
</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Proper subset</strong>: <span class="math">\(\forall x(x \in  A \to  x \in  B) \land  \exists x(x \in  B \land  x \in  A)\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Equal sets</strong>: For two equal sets, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
The Size of a Set
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>The size of a set</strong>: Let <span class="math">\(S\)</span> be a set. If there are exactly n distinct elements in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is a nonnegative integer, we say that <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is a finite set and that <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the cardinality of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. The cardinality of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math">\(|S|\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Power Sets
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Given a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the set <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. The power set of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math">\(P(S)\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Formula</strong>: If a set has <span class="math">\(n\)</span> elements, then its power set has <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> elements.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Cartesian Products
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ordered n-tuples</strong>: The ordered <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-tuple (<span class="math">\(a_1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span>, … , <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span>) is the ordered collection that has <span class="math">\(a_1\)</span> as its first element, <span class="math">\(a_2\)</span> as its second element, . . . , and <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> as its <span class="math">\(n\)</span>th element.
</li>
<li>
It's interesting to note that in a Cartesian system of 4 quadrants, the one that you learnt in elementary school and have been relearning in every math class since, can be expressed in terms of an ordered n-tuple. Specifically, it's a Cartesian product, an ordered pair.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cartesian product</strong>: Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> be sets. The Cartesian product of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math">\(A \times  B\)</span>, is the set of all ordered pairs <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a \in  A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \in  B\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math">\(A \times  B = \lbrace (a, b)&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; a \in  A \land  b \in  B\rbrace \)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Relation</strong>: A subset R of the Cartesian product <span class="math">\(A \times  B\)</span> is called a relation from the set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to the set <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Exercises
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
List the members of these sets.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace x&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; x \)</span> is a real number such that <span class="math">\(x^2\)</span> $ = 1$
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The two numbers that satisfy the quantification are <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Thus, this set is the set:
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace x&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; x\)</span> is a positive integer less than $ 12$
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\rbrace \)</span>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace x&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; x \)</span>is the square of an integer and <span class="math">\(x &lt; 100\rbrace \)</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2\rbrace \)</span>&lt;/li&gt;
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace x&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; x\)</span> is an integer such that <span class="math">\(x^2 = 2\rbrace \)</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace \rbrace \)</span>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
For each of these pairs of sets, determine whether the first is a subset of the second, the second is a subset of the first, or neither is a subset of the other.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
the set of airline flights from New York to New Delhi, the set of nonstop airline flights from New York to New Delhi
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Every element in the set of nonstop airline flights will also be an element in the set of all flights. Therefore, the second is subset of the first.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
the set of people who speak English, the set of people who speak Chinese
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Neither of these are subsets of the other.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
the set of flying squirrels, the set of living creatures that can fly
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The set of flying squirrels is <em>probably</em> an empty set. By definition, if it is the first set, then it will be a subset of the second set.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Determine which of these sets are equal:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace 1,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5\rbrace ,\lbrace 5,3,1\rbrace \)</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
These sets are equal because duplicates do not count.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace \lbrace 1\rbrace \rbrace ,\lbrace 1,\lbrace 1\rbrace \rbrace \)</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
These sets are not equal because <span class="math">\(\lbrace 1\rbrace \)</span> does not equal <span class="math">\(1\)</span>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\emptyset ,\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \)</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This is covered at the beginning of the chapter.

</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace x \in  R| \)</span>x is the square of an integer <span class="math">\(\rbrace \)</span>

<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace 2,\lbrace 2\rbrace \rbrace \)</span>
</p>

<ul>

<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace \lbrace \lbrace 2\rbrace \rbrace \rbrace \)</span>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
<strong>Union</strong>: Let A and B be sets. The union of the sets A and B, denoted by A B, is the set that contains those elements that are either in A or in B, or in both.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Quantification: <span class="math">\(A \cup  B = \lbrace x&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; x \in  A ∨ x \in  B\rbrace \)</span>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Intersection</strong>: Let <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> be sets. The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by <span class="math">\(A \cap  B\)</span>, is the set containing those elements in both A and B.
</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Disjoint</strong>: Two sets are called disjoint if their intersection is the empty set.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Difference</strong>: Let A and B be sets. The difference of A and B, denoted by A − B, is the set containing those elements that are in A but not in B. The difference of A and B is also called the complement of B with respect to A.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Complement</strong>: Let U be the universal set. The complement of the set A, denoted by A, is the complement of A with respect to U . Therefore, the complement of the set A is U − A.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Section 3 - Functions
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>
Let A and B be non empty sets. A function from A to B is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A. We write <span class="math">\(f(a) = b\)</span> if b is the unique element of B assigned by the function f to the element a of A. If f is a function from A to B, we write f : A B.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Also called functions and transformations.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If f is a function from A to B, we say that A is the domain of F and B is the codomain of f. If f(a) = b, we say that b is the image of a and a is the pre image of b. The range, or image, of f is the set of all images of elements of A.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Also, if f is a function from A to B. we say that f maps A to B.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Two functions are equal when they have the same domain, same codomain, and map each element identically.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Types of functions
</h4>

<h5>
Injective functions (One-to-One)
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is said to be one-to-one, or an injunction, where <span class="math">\(f(a) = f(b)  \equiv  a = b\)</span> for all a and b in the domain of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. <span class="math">\(A\)</span> functions said to be injective if it is one to one.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We can express that f is one to one with the quantification: <span class="math">\(\forall a\forall b(f(a) = f(b) \to  a = b)\)</span>, where the universe of discourse is the domain of the function.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Surjective functions (Onto)
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
A function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is called onto, or a surjection, if and only if for every <span class="math">\(b \in  B\)</span> there is an element <span class="math">\(a \in  A\)</span> with <span class="math">\(f(a) = b\)</span>. a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is called surjective if it is onto.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What this means that if you have two sets of things, A and B, a function f is said to be onto if every element b B has an element a A such that <span class="math">\(f(a) = b\)</span>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\forall  a \in  A(\exists  b \in  B(f(a) = b)))\)</span>
</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Bijective functions (Onto and One-to-One)
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
If and only if <span class="math">\((f(a) = f(b) \to  a = b) \land  (\forall  b \in  B(\exists  a \in  A f(a) = b))\)</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Partial functions
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
A <strong>partial function</strong> f from a set A to a set B is an assignment to each element a in a subset of A, called the domain of definition of f , of a unique element b in B.
</li>
<li>
The sets A and B are called the domain and codomain of f, respectively. We say that f is undefined for elements in A that are not in the domain of definition of f.
</li>
<li>
When the domain of definition of f equals A, we say that f is a <strong>total function</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Increasing and decreasing
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
A function f whose domain and codomain are subsets of real numbers is called <strong>increasing</strong> if f(x) ≤ f(y), and strictly increasing if f(x) &lt; f(y), whenever x &lt; y and x and y are in the domain of f. Invert all of that for decreasing and strictly decreasing.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Inverse functions
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
A one-to-one correspondence is called invertible because we can define an inverse of this function. A function is not invertible if it is not a one-to-one correspondence, because the inverse of such a function does not exist.
</li>
<li>
A function must be injective to be invertible.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Rules
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
To show that f is <strong>injective</strong>: Show that if f(x) = f(y) for arbitrary x,y A with x != y then x = y.
</li>
<li>
To show that f is <strong>not injective</strong>: Find particular elements x, y A such that x != y and f(x) = f(y).
</li>
<li>
To show that f is <strong>surjective</strong>: Consider an arbitrary element y B and find an element x A such that f (x) = y.
</li>
<li>
To show that f is <strong>not surjective</strong>: Find a particular y B such that f(x) != y for all x A.
</li>
</ul>

CS 205 Quiz #4B
</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>
For each of the following statements, provide the cardinality of the result.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 3, 4\rbrace \)</span> - Being as there is a duplicate, it does not count towards the cardinality of the result, which is just the count of the elements. 4
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\emptyset  \cup  \lbrace 1, 2, \emptyset , \emptyset \rbrace \)</span> - Union means that one includes the elements from both sets in the final set. In the second set, there are two of the same element. Only one counts towards the cardinality. There are no elements to union in the first set, so effectively, the second set is the only one that counts. The cardinality is therefore, 3.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\emptyset  \cap  \lbrace 1, 2, \emptyset , \emptyset \rbrace \)</span> - The question in English is something like, &quot;What is the cardinality of the set of things that the empty set and this set share?&quot; The empty set intersected with anything will yield a cardinality of 0.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace 1, 2, \emptyset , \emptyset \rbrace  - \emptyset \)</span> - &quot;Take away all the elements in the empty set away from this set.&quot; Inevitably, I think that the result of this operation will be the unchanged set on the left of the operation. Being as there is a duplicate element, the cardinality is 3.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\emptyset  \cap  \lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace \)</span> - &quot;What does the empty set share with with this set containing the empty set and a set containing the empty set.&quot; It can only be an empty set … right? 0.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\emptyset  \cup  \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace  \cup  \lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace \)</span> - &quot;What is the resulting set from combining the empty set set with a set containing the empty set and a set containing a set which contains the empty set.&quot; Cardinality: 2. (The empty set contains no elements, but the other two are sets containing the empty set and a set containing a set which contains the empty set.&quot;
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace  \times  \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \)</span> - I think this results in a set that looks like this: <span class="math">\(\lbrace (\emptyset , \emptyset )\rbrace \)</span>. That would be the Cartesian double of the operation, but I'm not sure if the item inside the set is a set, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't affect this particular problem. The cardinality is 1. Interesting to note: the Cartesian product of any set with the empty set is the empty set.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(\lbrace 1, 1\rbrace  \times  \lbrace 3, 3\rbrace \)</span> - This yields: <span class="math">\(\lbrace \lbrace 1,3\rbrace , \lbrace 1, 3\rbrace , \lbrace 1,3\rbrace , \lbrace 1, 3\rbrace \rbrace \)</span>. Bobby says the answer is 4, but I think those sets are duplicates. So 4.
</li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\((\lbrace 1, 2\rbrace  \times  \lbrace 3, 4\rbrace ) \times  \lbrace 5, 6\rbrace \)</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Yields: <span class="math">\(\lbrace \lbrace 1, 3\rbrace , \lbrace 1, 4\rbrace , \lbrace 2, 3\rbrace , \lbrace 2, 4\rbrace \rbrace  \times  \lbrace 5, 6\rbrace \)</span>
</li>
<li>
Contin: <span class="math">\(\lbrace \lbrace \lbrace 1, 3\rbrace , 5\rbrace , \lbrace \lbrace 1, 4\rbrace , 5\rbrace , \lbrace \lbrace 2, 3\rbrace , 5\rbrace , \lbrace \lbrace 2, 4\rbrace , 5\rbrace  … \rbrace \)</span>
</li>
<li>
The cardinality is 8.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(\emptyset  \times  \emptyset \)</span> - The empty set multiplied by any other set, including the empty set, yields the empty set, thus the cardinality must be zero. Additionally, I just read the proof that the cardinality of a product of sets is the number of elements in both sets multiplied by each other, which also leads me to zero.
</p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="math">\(\lbrace \lbrace 1, 2\rbrace  \times  \lbrace 3, 4\rbrace \rbrace  - \lbrace \lbrace 3, 4\rbrace  \times  \lbrace 2, 1\rbrace \rbrace \)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(A = \lbrace \lbrace 1, 3\rbrace , \lbrace 1, 4\rbrace , \lbrace 2, 3\rbrace , \lbrace 2, 4\rbrace \rbrace \)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(B = \lbrace \lbrace 3, 2\rbrace , \lbrace 3, 1\rbrace , \lbrace 4, 2\rbrace , \lbrace 4, 1\rbrace \rbrace \)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(A - B\)</span> will equal the set that has all the elements of A which B does not have. Cardinality: 4.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
For each of the following statements, provide the cardinality of the result:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace 1, 2\rbrace )\)</span> - There is no trickery here, so the cardinality of this power set is simply two raised to the number of elements in the set.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace \rbrace ) \cap  P(\lbrace 1\rbrace )\)</span> - So the power set of the empty set yields a set containing the empty set. The power set of the set containing one is a set containing a set containing one and the empty set. Thus:
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(|\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace  \cap  \lbrace \lbrace 1\rbrace , \emptyset \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = 1\)</span>

</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace \rbrace ) \cup  P(\lbrace 1\rbrace )\)</span> - <span class="math">\(|\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace  \cup  \lbrace \lbrace 1\rbrace , \emptyset \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = 2\)</span>

</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace ) \cup  P(\lbrace 1\rbrace )\)</span> - Alright, so what we're looking at is the union of the power set of a set containing the empty set with a set containing the integer one. Each set has a cardinality of 2 because they contain one element. - <span class="math">\(|\lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace , \emptyset \rbrace  \cup  \lbrace \lbrace 1\rbrace , \emptyset \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = |\lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace , \lbrace 1\rbrace , \emptyset \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = 3\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace ) \cap  P(\lbrace 1\rbrace )\)</span> - The general idea surrounding the power set of a nested empty set is that the resulting set will always be the empty set and the set containing the nested empty set. - <span class="math">\(|\lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace \lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace \rbrace \rbrace  \cap  \lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace 1\rbrace \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = |\lbrace \emptyset \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = 1\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace ) \cup  P(\lbrace 1\rbrace )\)</span> - <span class="math">\(|\lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace \lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace \rbrace \rbrace  \cup  \lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace 1\rbrace \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = |\lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace \lbrace \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace \rbrace , \lbrace 1\rbrace \rbrace&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; = 3\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace 1, 2\rbrace  \cup  \lbrace 3\rbrace )\)</span> - <span class="math">\(|P(\lbrace 1, 2\rbrace  \cup  \lbrace 3\rbrace )| = |P(\lbrace 1, 2, 3\rbrace )| = 2^3\)</span>

</li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>
For each of the following statements, provide the cardinality of the result.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="math">\(P(\lbrace 1, 2, 3\rbrace ) - P(\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\rbrace )\)</span> - <span class="math">\(A = P(\lbrace 1, 2, 3\rbrace ) = \lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace 1\rbrace , \lbrace 2\rbrace , \lbrace 3\rbrace , \lbrace 1, 2\rbrace , \lbrace 1, 2, 3\rbrace , \lbrace 2, 3\rbrace , \lbrace 1, 3\rbrace \rbrace \)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
So I think that every element in the set above will be contained in the power set of the set to the right of the question. In which case, if I'm taking away every element in B (the one on the right of question) from A, and B contains every element in A, I'll be left with the empty set. Which has a cardinality of 0.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\rbrace ) - P(\lbrace 1, 2, 3\rbrace )\)</span> - Now this is much more interesting. So, as an informal proof of the answer, call the power set on the left A and the power set on the right B. Every element in B will be an element in A. A will have 2^5 elements, and B will have 2^3 elements. A ha! I was right, my test is marked wrongly.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(P(\emptyset ) - P(\emptyset ))\)</span> - The power set of the empty set is <span class="math">\(\lbrace \emptyset , \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \rbrace \)</span>. This question is basically asking for the cardinality of the power set of the empty set, which is 2.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P(P(P(P(\emptyset ))))\)</span> -
</li>
</ul>

|P(P(P(P())))| = |P(P(P(, )))| = |P(P(, , , , ))| = |P(, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , )| = 2^16

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
An <strong>algorithm</strong> is a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.
</li>
<li>
<p>Properties of Algorithms</p>
<ul>
<li>
Input. An algorithm has input values from a specified set.
</li>
<li>
Output. From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified set. The output values are the solution to the problem.
</li>
<li>
Definiteness. The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.
</li>
<li>
Correctness. An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.
</li>
<li>
Finiteness. An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps large) number of steps for any input in the set.
</li>
<li>
Effectiveness. It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount of time.
</li>
<li>
Generality. The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not just for a particular set of input values.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Searching Algorithms
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Linear search</strong>, searching through a list of items one at a time until the desired value is found.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Binary search</strong>, which is performing a search on an ordered list of entries, starting in the middle, then going to the &quot;middle of the middle&quot;, then its middle, until the item is either found or shown to not exist.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Sorting
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sorting</strong> is putting these elements into a list in which the elements are in increasing order.
</li>
</ul>

Section 2 - The Growth of Functions
</h3>

<h4>
Big-O Notation
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Let <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> be functions. We say that <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(O(g(x))\)</span> if there are constants <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(|f(x)| ≤ C|g(x)|\)</span> whenever <span class="math">\(x &gt; k\)</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Intuitively, the definition that <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(O(g(x))\)</span> says that <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> grows slower that some fixed multiple of <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> as <span class="math">\(x\)</span> grows without bound.
</li>
<li>
To show that <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(O(g(x))\)</span>, we need find only one pair of constants <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, the witnesses, such that <span class="math">\(|f(x)| ≤ C|g(x)|\)</span> whenever <span class="math">\(x &gt; k\)</span>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A useful approach for finding a pair of witnesses is to first select a value of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> for which the size of <span class="math">\(|f(x)|\)</span> can be readily estimated when <span class="math">\(x &gt; k\)</span> and to see whether we can use this estimate to find a value of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(|f(x)| ≤ C|g(x)|\)</span> for <span class="math">\(x &gt; k\)</span>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Example 1
</h5>

<p>
Show that <span class="math">\(f(x)= x^2 + 2x + 1\)</span> is <span class="math">\(O(x2)\)</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
When <span class="math">\(x &gt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x^2 + 2x + 1 &lt; x^2 + 2x^2 + x^2 = 4x^2\)</span>
</li>
<li>
Stripping coefficients, <span class="math">\(O(x^2)\)</span> where <span class="math">\(C = 4\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k = 1\)</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Example 2
</h5>

<p>
Show that <span class="math">\(7x^2\)</span> is <span class="math">\(O(x^3)\)</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
When <span class="math">\(x &gt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(7x^2 &lt; 7x^3\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Where <span class="math">\(C = 7\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K = 1\)</span> are witnesses, <span class="math">\(7x^2&#39; is\)</span>O(x^3)$
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Example 3
</h5>

<p>
Show that <span class="math">\(n^2\)</span> is not <span class="math">\(O(n)\)</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Where <span class="math">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n^2\)</span> is not less than <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Example 4
</h5>

<p>
Example 2 shows that <span class="math">\(7x^2\)</span> is <span class="math">\(O(x^3)\)</span>. Is it also true that <span class="math">\(x^3\)</span> is <span class="math">\(O(7x^2)\)</span>?

Lecture (Assorted)

<h4>
Algorithms
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
An algorithm is a &quot;recipe&quot;, a finite set of instructions that precisely outline how to accomplish a task, function, etc.
</li>
<li>
<p>Something we always have to deal with in computer science is lists. For instance, the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(13, 4, 9, 10, 7\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which is the maximum?</p>
<ul>
<li>
The way to answer this is to have an algorithm.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Complexity
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
Two considerations:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Space
</li>
<li>
Time (number of operations, comparisons perhaps)
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
&quot;If my unit of work is a comparison, then the complexity of the max algorithm is going the same as the number of inputs.&quot;
</p></li>
<li>
There are algorithms that are more &quot;efficient&quot; than others in that they take less comparisons or operations than an alternative algorithm which performs the same function. For instance, for the greatest element example, binary search on a sorted array is more efficient, that is, takes less operations to perform the same function (but requires a sorted array).
</li>
<li>
He is now going through binary search.
</li>
<li>
<p>Some questions about any given algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>
What is the best case?
</li>
<li>
What is the average case?
</li>
<li>
What is the average case?
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Big O and Efficiency Analysis
</h4>

<h5>
Big O
</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>
What's quite not completely correct about this?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Big O allows you to filter out constants
</li>
<li>
This can cause problems with certain constants
</li>
<li>
There exists c_1, c_2, and k such that c * g(x) ##### P = NP ?

Graphs
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
A <strong>graph</strong> <span class="math">\(G = (V,E)\)</span> consists of <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, a nonempty set of vertices (or nodes) and <span class="math">\(E\)</span>, a set of edges.
</li>
<li><p>
Each <strong>edge</strong> has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its <strong>endpoints</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
An edge is said to connect its endpoints.

Section 2 - Graph Terminology and Special Types of Graphs
</h3>

<h4>
Basic Terminology
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Two vertices <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> in an undirected graph G are called <strong>adjacent</strong> (or neighbors) in <span class="math">\(G\)</span> if <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> are endpoints of an edge <span class="math">\(e\)</span> of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
An edge <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is called <strong>incident</strong> with the vertices <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span> and <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is said to connect <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
The set of all neighbors of a vertex v of <span class="math">\(G = (V,E)\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math">\(N(v)\)</span>, is called the <strong>neighborhood</strong> of <span class="math">\(v\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, we denote by <span class="math">\(N(A)\)</span> the set of all vertices in <span class="math">\(G\)</span> that are adjacent to at least one vertex in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. So, <span class="math">\(N(A) = U \in  A N(v)\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
The <em>degree of a vertex in an undirected graph</em> is the number of edges incident with it, except that a loop at a vertex contributes twice to the degree of that vertex. The degree of the vertex <span class="math">\(v\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math">\(deg(v)\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
A vertex of degree zero is called <strong>isolated</strong>.
</li>
<li>
A vertex is <strong>pendant</strong> if and only if it has degree one.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Some Special Simple Graphs
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Complete graphs</strong> are simple graphs that contain exactly one edge between each pair of distinct vertices.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Non-complete</strong> graphs have at least one pair of distinct vertices not connected by an edge.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cycles</strong> consist of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> vertices and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> edges between distinct vertices.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Wheels</strong> are where cycles receive a center which each vertices connects to.
</li>
<li>
<strong>N-dimensional hypercubes</strong>, or n-cube, denoted by <span class="math">\(Q_n\)</span>, are a graph that has vertices representing the <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> bit strings of length <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Two vertices are adjacent if and only if the bit strings that they represent differ in exactly one bit position.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Bipartite Graphs
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
A simple graph G is called <strong>bipartite</strong> if its vertex set <span class="math">\(V\)</span> can be partitioned into two disjoint sets <span class="math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V_2\)</span> such that every edge in the graph connects a vertex in <span class="math">\(V_1\)</span> and a vertex in <span class="math">\(V_2\)</span> (so that no edge in <span class="math">\(G\)</span> connects either two vertices in <span class="math">\(V_1\)</span> or two vertices in <span class="math">\(V_2\)</span>). When this condition holds, we call the pair <span class="math">\((V_1, V_2)\)</span> a bipartition of the vertex set <span class="math">\(V\)</span> of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
A <strong>complete bipartite graph</strong> <span class="math">\(K_\lbrace m,n\rbrace \)</span> is a graph that has its vertex set partitioned into two subsets of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> vertices, respectively with an edge between two vertices if and only if one vertex is in the first subset and the other vertex is in the second subset.

<h3>
Section 3 - Representing Graphs and Graph Isomorphism
</h3>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
When two graphs have exactly the same form, in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertex sets that preserves edges, they are called <strong>isomorphic</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Representing Graphs
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
One way to represent a graph is with an <strong>adjacency list</strong>, which lists vertices on one side and all their adjacent vertices on the other.
</li>
<li>
By listing vertices with their corresponding terminal vertices, it's possible to construct a <strong>directed adjacency list</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Adjacency Matrices
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
It's also possible to define a graph using a matrices, which is convenient for complex graphs and computation.
</li>
<li>
If <span class="math">\(A_\lbrace ij\rbrace \)</span> = 1, then there is an edge between them.
</li>
<li>
Else <span class="math">\(A_\lbrace ij\rbrace \)</span> = 0, and there is no edge between them.
</li>
<li>
When a graph does not contain many edges, it is <strong>sparse</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Conversely, when a graph does contain many edges, it is <strong>dense</strong>.
</li>
<li>
So each column represents a vertices, and each 1 in a given row represents the other vertices it is connected to.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Incidence Matrices
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(m_\lbrace ij\rbrace  = is edge e_j incident with v_i ? 1 : 0\)</span>
</li>
<li>
What this means is that each column with have two ones in it, and each row represents a vertices.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Isomorphism of Graphs
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The simple graphs <span class="math">\(G1 = (V1, E1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(G2 = (V2, E2)\)</span> are isomorphic if there exists a one- to-one and onto function f from <span class="math">\(V_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(V_2\)</span> with the property that a and b are adjacent in G1 if and only if <span class="math">\(f(a)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f(b)\)</span> are adjacent in <span class="math">\(G_2\)</span>, for all <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(V_1\)</span>. Such a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is called an isomorphism. Two simple graphs that are not isomorphic are called non-isomorphic.
</li>
<li>
The bipartite graph <span class="math">\(G = (V , E)\)</span> with bipartition <span class="math">\((V_1,V_2)\)</span> has a complete matching from <span class="math">\(V_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(V_2\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(|N(A)|  \le  |A|\)</span> for all subsets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> of <span class="math">\(V_1\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Section 2 - Application of Trees
</h3>

<h4>
Introduction
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Three problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
How should items in a list be stored so that an item can be easily located?
</li>
<li>
What series of decisions should be made to find an object with a certain property in a collection of objects of a certain type?
</li>
<li>
How should a set of characters be efficiently coded by bit strings?
</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Binary Search Trees
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
a <strong>binary search tree</strong> a binary tree in which:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
each child of a vertex is designated as a right or left child,
</li>
<li>
no vertex has more than one right child or left child, and
</li>
<li>
each vertex is labeled with a key, which is one of the items.
</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>
Vertices are assigned keys so that the key of a vertex is both larger than the keys of all vertices in its left subtree and smaller than the keys of all vertices in its right subtree.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Decision Trees
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
a <strong>decision tree</strong> is a rooted tree in which each internal vertex corresponds to a decision, with a subtree at these vertices for each possible outcome of the decision.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Prefix Codes
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Prefix codes</strong> are one way to ensure that no bit string corresponds to more than one sequence of letters is to encode letters so that the bit string for a letter never occurs as the first part of the bit string for another letter.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Huffman Coding
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Huffman coding</strong> is an algorithm that takes as input the frequencies (which are the probabilities of occurrences) of symbols in a string and produces as output a prefix code that encodes the string using the fewest possible bits, among all possible binary prefix codes for these symbols.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Game Trees
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Game trees</strong> are trees that can be used to analyze certain types of games such as tic-tac-toe, nim, checkers, and chess. In each of these games, two players take turns making moves.
</li>
<li>
The vertices of these trees represent the positions that a game can be in as it progresses; the edges represent legal moves between these positions.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>

Section 3 - Tree Traversal

<h4>
Traversal Algorithms
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Procedures for systematically visiting every vertex of an ordered rooted tree are called <strong>traversal algorithms</strong>.
</li>
<li><p>
We will describe three of the most commonly used such algorithms,
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
<strong>Preorder traversal</strong>: Visit root, visit subtrees left to right. <em>(VLR)</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Let <span class="math">\(T\)</span> be an ordered rooted tree with root <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(T\)</span> consists only of <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the preorder traversal of <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. Otherwise, suppose that <span class="math">\(T_1, T_2, … , T_n\)</span> are the subtrees at <span class="math">\(r\)</span> from left to right in <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. The preorder traversal begins by visiting <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. It continues by traversing <span class="math">\(T_1\)</span> in preorder, then <span class="math">\(T_2\)</span> in preorder, and so on, until <span class="math">\(T_n\)</span> is traversed in preorder.
</li>
<li>
Example from standard tree: <span class="math">\(a, b, e, j, k, n, o, p, f, c, d, g, l, m, h, i\)</span>
</li>
<li><p>
Algorithm:
</p>

<pre><code>procedure preorder(T : ordered rooted tree) 
    r :=root of T
    list r
    for each child c of r from left to right
        T (c) := subtree with c as its root preorder(T (c))
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Inorder traversal</strong>: Visit left subtree, visit root, visit right subtree. <em>(LVR)</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Let <span class="math">\(T\)</span> be an ordered rooted tree with root <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(T\)</span> consists only of <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, then r is the inorder traversal of <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. Otherwise, suppose that <span class="math">\(T_1, T_2, … , T_n\)</span> are the subtrees at r from left to right. The inorder traversal begins by traversing <span class="math">\(T_1\)</span> in inorder, then visiting <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. It continues by traversing T_2 in inorder, then T_3 in inorder, … , and finally <span class="math">\(T_n\)</span> in inorder.
</li>
<li>
Example from standard tree: <span class="math">\(j, e, n, k, o, p, b, f, a, c, l, g, m, d, h, i\)</span>
</li>
<li><p>
Algorithm:
</p>

<pre><code>procedure inorder(T : ordered rooted tree) 
r := root of T
if r is a leaf, then list r
else
    l := first child of r from left to right
    T (l) := subtree with l as its root inorder(T (l))  
    list r
    for (each child c of r except for l from left to right)
        T(c) := subtree with c as its root
        inorder(T (c))
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Postorder traversal</strong>: Visit subtrees left to right, visit root. <em>(LRV)</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Let <span class="math">\(T\)</span> be an ordered rooted tree with root <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(T\)</span> consists only of <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, then r is the postorder traversal of <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. Otherwise, suppose that <span class="math">\(T_1, T_2, … , T_n\)</span> are the subtrees at <span class="math">\(r\)</span> from left to right. The postorder traversal begins by traversing <span class="math">\(T_1\)</span> in postorder, then <span class="math">\(T_2\)</span> in postorder, … , then <span class="math">\(T_n\)</span> in postorder, and ends by visiting <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
Example from standard tree: <span class="math">\(j, n, o, p, k, e, f, b, c, l, m, g, h, i, d, a\)</span>
</li>
<li><p>
Algorithm:
</p>

<pre><code>procedure postorder(T : ordered rooted tree) 
r :=rootofT
for each child c of r from left to right
    T (c) := subtree with c as its root
    postorder(T (c)) 
list r
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Infix, Prefix, and Postfix Notation
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
To make such expressions unambiguous it is necessary to include parentheses in the <em>inorder traversal</em> whenever we encounter an operation. The fully parenthesized expression obtained in this way is said to be in <strong>infix form</strong>.
</li>
<li>
We obtain the <strong>postfix form</strong> of an expression by traversing its binary tree in <em>postorder</em>.
</li>
</ul>

Huffman Coding
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
So we have some text we want to consider and we want to encode.
</li>
<li>
How do we store data? It's all in binary.
</li>
<li>
How can we store the Gettysburg address using the minimum amount of bits possible?
</li>
<li>
How do we compress the data?
</li>
<li>
For this text specifically, if we convert all lower case to upper case, and we ignore the special symbols, but we do have space and break, and comma, dash, period, question mark, all characters. The numbers of those are as follows, <insert here>
</li>
<li><p>
If we want to use binary to represent this address, what is the first way we might do that?
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We may be tempted to use ASCII or UTF8
</li>
<li>
If we encoded the Gettysburg address using 8 bits, it would result in 11856 total bits, almost twelve thousand.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
What are some ways we can do better than this?
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
We could come up with unique coding attempt using solely 5 bits, as there are 32 unique characters in the Gettysburg address.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
This result in 7410.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
We could take the most frequent characters and give them shorter codes.
</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
In order to find out the average over an entire document, we have to do a weighted sum, ex, we have 282 three bit, 165 three bit … etc.
</p></li>
</ul>

Phrase-Structure Grammars
</h4>

<h5>
Definition 1 - Vocabulary and Word
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
A <em>vocabulary</em> (or <em>alphabet</em>) V is a finite, nonempty set of elements called symbols. A <em>word</em> (or <em>sentence</em>) over <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is a string of finite length of elements of <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. The <em>empty string</em> or <em>null string</em>, denoted by <span class="math">\(\Alpha \)</span>, is the string containing no symbols. The set of all words over <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math">\(V∗\)</span>. A language over <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(V∗\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
A <em>grammar</em> provides a set of symbols of various types and a set of rules for producing <em>words</em>. More precisely, a grammar has a <strong>vocabulary</strong> <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, which is a set of symbols used to derive members of the language.
</li>
<li>
Some of the elements of the <em>vocabulary</em> cannot be replaced by other symbols. These are called <strong>terminals</strong>, and the other members of the <em>vocabulary</em>, which can be replaced by other symbols, are called <strong>nonterminals</strong>.
</li>
<li>
There is a special member of the vocabulary called the <strong>start symbol</strong>, denoted by <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, which is the element of the vocabulary that we always begin with.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Definition 2 - Terminal Symbols
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
A <em>phrase-structure grammar</em> <span class="math">\(G = (V, T, S, P)\)</span> consists of a vocabulary <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, a subset <span class="math">\(T\)</span> of <span class="math">\(V\)</span> consisting of <strong>terminal symbols</strong>, a start symbol <span class="math">\(S\)</span> from <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, and a finite set of productions <span class="math">\(P\)</span>. The set <span class="math">\(V − T\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. Elements of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> are called <strong>nonterminal symbols</strong>. Every production in <span class="math">\(P\)</span> must contain at least one nonterminal on its left side.
</li>
</ul>

<h6>
Example 1
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
Let <span class="math">\(G = (V,T,S,P)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V = \lbrace a,b,A,B,S\rbrace \)</span>, <span class="math">\(T = \lbrace a,b\rbrace \)</span>, <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the <strong>start symbol</strong>, and <span class="math">\(P = \lbrace S \to  ABa, A \to  BB, B \to  ab, AB \to  b\rbrace \)</span>. <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is an example of a <strong>phrase-structure grammar</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Definition 3 -
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
Let <span class="math">\(G = (V , T , S, P)\)</span> be a phrase-structure grammar. Let <span class="math">\(w_0 = l&lt;em&gt;z_0&lt;/em&gt;r\)</span> (that is, the concatenation of <span class="math">\(l,z_0\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(r\)</span>) and <span class="math">\(w_1 = l&lt;em&gt;z_1&lt;/em&gt;r\)</span> be strings over <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(z_0 \to  z_1\)</span> is a production of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, we say that <span class="math">\(w_1\)</span> is directly derivable from <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span> and we write <span class="math">\(w0 ⇒ w1\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(w_0, w_1, …, w_n\)</span> are strings over <span class="math">\(V\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(w_0 ⇒ w_1, w_1 ⇒ w_2,…, w_n−1 ⇒ w_n\)</span>, then we say that <span class="math">\(w_n\)</span> is derivable from <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span>, and we write <span class="math">\(w_0 ⇒∗ w_n\)</span>. The sequence of steps used to obtain <span class="math">\(w_n\)</span> from <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span> is called a derivation.
</li>
</ul>

<h6>
Example 2
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
The string <span class="math">\(Aaba\)</span> is directly derivable from <span class="math">\(ABa\)</span> in the grammar in Example 1 because <span class="math">\(B \to  ab\)</span> is a production in the grammar. The string <span class="math">\(abababa\)</span> is derivable from <span class="math">\(ABa\)</span> because <span class="math">\(ABa ⇒ Aaba ⇒ BBaba ⇒ Bababa ⇒ abababa\)</span>, using the productions <span class="math">\(B \to  ab, A \to  BB, B \to  ab,\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B \to  ab\)</span> in succession.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Definition 4
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
Let <span class="math">\(G = (V , T , S, P)\)</span> be a phrase-structure grammar. The <strong>language generated</strong> by <span class="math">\(G\)</span> (or the language of G), denoted by <span class="math">\(L(G)\)</span>, is the set of all strings of terminals that are derivable from the starting state S. In other words, <span class="math">\(L(G)=\lbrace w\in T∗|S⇒∗ w\rbrace \)</span>.
</li>
</ul>

<h6>
Example 3
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be the grammar with vocabulary <span class="math">\(V = \lbrace S, A, a, b\rbrace \)</span>, set of terminals <span class="math">\(T = \lbrace a, b\rbrace \)</span>, starting symbol S, and productions <span class="math">\(P = \lbrace S \to  aA, S \to  b, A \to  aa\rbrace \)</span>. What is <span class="math">\(L(G)\)</span>, the <strong>language of this grammar</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>
There are odd numbers of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>s greater than 1 terminated by a <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>

<h6>
Example 7
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
One grammar that generates the set <span class="math">\(\lbrace 0n1n2n&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; n = 0,1,2,3,…\rbrace \)</span> is <span class="math">\(G = (V,T,S,P)\)</span> with <span class="math">\(V = \lbrace 0,1,2,S,A,B,C\rbrace \)</span>; <span class="math">\(T = \lbrace 0,1,2\rbrace \)</span>; starting state <span class="math">\(S\)</span>; and production <span class="math">\(S \to  C\)</span>, <span class="math">\(C \to  0CAB\)</span>, <span class="math">\(S \to  \Alpha \)</span>, <span class="math">\(BA \to  AB\)</span>, <span class="math">\(0A \to  01\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1A \to  11\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1B \to  12\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(2B \to  22\)</span>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Types of Phrase-Structure Grammars
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
A <strong>type 0 grammar</strong> has no restrictions on its productions.
</li>
<li><p>
A <strong>type 1 grammar</strong> can have productions of the form <span class="math">\(w1 \to  w2\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(w_1 = lAr\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w_2 = lwr\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a nonterminal symbol, <span class="math">\(l\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> are strings of zero or more terminal or nonterminal symbols, and <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is a nonempty string of terminal or nonterminal symbols.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A language generated by a type 1 grammar is called a <strong>context-sensitive language</strong>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A <strong>type 2 grammar</strong> can have productions only of the form <span class="math">\(w1 \to  w2\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(w_1\)</span> is a single symbol that is not a terminal symbol.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Type 2 grammars are called <strong>context-free grammars</strong> because a <em>nonterminal symbol</em> that is the left side of a <em>production</em> can be replaced in a string whenever it occurs, no matter what else is in the string.
</li>
<li>
A language generated by a type 2 grammar is called a <strong>context-free language</strong>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
A <strong>type 3 grammar</strong> can have productions only of the form <span class="math">\(w1 \to  w_2\)</span> with <span class="math">\(w_1 = A\)</span> and either <span class="math">\(w_2 = aB\)</span> or <span class="math">\(w_2 = a\)</span>, where A and B are nonterminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol, or with <span class="math">\(w1 =S\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w2 = \Alpha \)</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Type 3 grammars are also called <strong>regular grammars</strong>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
The other way that context-sensitive grammars are defined is by specifying that all productions are <strong>noncontracting</strong>. A grammar with this property is called <strong>noncontracting</strong> or <strong>monotonic</strong>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h6>
Example 8
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
From Example 6 we know that <span class="math">\(\lbrace 0^m 1^n&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; m,n = 0,1,2,…\rbrace \)</span> is are regular language,because it can be generated by a regular grammar, namely, the grammar <span class="math">\(G2\)</span> in Example 6.
</li>
</ul>

<h6>
Example 9
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
It follows from Example 5 that <span class="math">\(\lbrace 0^n 1^n&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; n = 0, 1, 2, ... \rbrace \)</span> is a <strong>context-free language</strong>, because the productions in this grammar are S 0S1 and S .
</li>
</ul>

<h6>
Example 10
</h6>

<ul>
<li>
The set <span class="math">\(\lbrace 0^n 1^n 2^n&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; n = 0, 1, 2, ... \rbrace \)</span> is a <strong>context-sensitive language</strong>, because it can be generated by a <strong>type 1 grammar</strong>, as Example 7 shows, but not by any type 2 language.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Types of Grammars
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Type 0</strong>: No restrictions
</li>
<li>
<strong>Type 1</strong>: <span class="math">\(w_1 = lAr\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w_2 = lwr\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(A \in  N, l, r, w \in  (N \cup  T )∗\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w  ̸= \Alpha \)</span>; + or <span class="math">\(w_1 = S\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w_2 = \Alpha \)</span> as long as <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is not on the right-hand side of another production
</li>
<li>
<strong>Type 2</strong>: <span class="math">\(w_1 = A\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a nonterminal symbol
</li>
<li>
<strong>Type 3</strong>: <span class="math">\(w_1 = A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w_2 = aB\)</span> or <span class="math">\(w_2 = a\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(A \in  N, B \in  N\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(a \in  T\)</span> ; or <span class="math">\(w_1 = S\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w_2 = \Alpha \)</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Derivation Trees
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A derivation in the language generated by a <strong>context-free grammar</strong> can be represented graphically using an <strong>ordered rooted tree</strong>, called a <strong>derivation</strong>, or <strong>parse tree</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the production <span class="math">\(A \to  w\)</span> arises in the derivation, where <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is a word, the vertex that represents <span class="math">\(A\)</span> has as children vertices that represent each symbol in <span class="math">\(w\)</span>, in order from left to right.
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>
Example 11
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
Construct a <strong>derivation tree</strong> for the derivation of the &quot;hungry rabbit eats quickly&quot;, given in the introduction of this section.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Example 12
</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine whether the word cbab belongs to the language generated by the grammar <span class="math">\(G = (V,T,S,P)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V = \lbrace a,b,c,A,B,C,S\rbrace \)</span>, <span class="math">\(T = \lbrace a,b,c\rbrace \)</span>, <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the starting symbol, and the productions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="math">\(S \to  AB\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(A \to  Ca\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(B \to  Ba\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(B \to  Cb\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(B \to  b\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(C \to  cb\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(C \to  b\)</span>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Backus–Naur Form
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>
The Backus–Naur form is used to specify the syntactic rules of many computer languages, including Java.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The <em>productions</em> in a <em>type 2 grammar</em> have a single <em>nonterminal symbol</em> as their left-hand side.
</li>
<li>
Instead of listing all the <em>productions</em> separately, we can combine all those with the same <em>nonterminal symbol</em> on the left-hand side into one statement.
</li>
<li>
Instead of using the symbol <span class="math">\(\to \)</span> in a production, we use the symbol <span class="math">\(::=\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
We enclose all <em>nonterminal symbols</em> in brackets, <span class="math">\(⟨⟩\)</span>, and we list all the right-hand sides of <em>productions</em> in the same statement, separating them by bars.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
For instance, the productions <span class="math">\(A \to  Aa\)</span>, <span class="math">\(A \to  a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(A \to  AB\)</span> can be combined into <span class="math">\(⟨A⟩ ::= ⟨A⟩a&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; a&amp;#58;|&amp;#58; ⟨A⟩⟨B⟩\)</span>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Recitation
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
If you have some sentence <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, then you can split it into a noun <span class="math">\(N\)</span> and a verb <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, which can be variable.
</li>
<li><p>
Where a graph is a set of vertices and a set of edges, a grammar is composed of:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<span class="math">\(V\)</span>, the <strong>vocabulary</strong>, which is all the symbols possible;
</li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(T\)</span>, the <strong>terminals</strong>, which is a subset of <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, and it is the symbols that are not used to generate new symbols, this means that they do not contain any symbols which can be translated into any other symbols;
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Lower case letters denote terminals.
</li>
<li>
Upper case letters denote non-terminals, and they are defined by <span class="math">\(N = V - T\)</span>.
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<span class="math">\(S\)</span>, the <strong>start symbol</strong>, which is a member of the vocabulary, and where you start from; and
</p></li>
<li>
<span class="math">\(P\)</span>, the <strong>productions</strong>, which are what you can derive from symbols or set of symbols.
</li>
</ol></li>

<h5>
Chomsky Hierarchy

<li><p>
If it is of <strong>type 1</strong>, we have to have <span class="math">\(w_1 = lAr\)</span> where <span class="math">\(l\)</span> is a possibly empty string, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is nonterminal, and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is a possibly empty string, and <span class="math">\(w_2 = lwr\)</span> where <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is a nonempty string.

</li>
<li>
type 1 is context senstive
