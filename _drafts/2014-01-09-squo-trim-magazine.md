<blockquote>With his show, SQUO retains that hard-hitting urge to dance from the music of house 
parties and nightclubs while adding an underground, undiscovered, up-and-comingness 
into his mix; the sound is unapologetically electronic. His style is not the polite 
bass of electronic music has become known for, but rather the grittier, more soulful 
bass of artists like Branchez, Trippy Turtles, and Victor Niglio.<br><br>
