description: | 
              I was born in June of 1993 in Birmingham, England into an English/Irish home. 
              After three years and my sister was born, my family moved to Fleurey-Sur-Ouche,
              France, where we would spend the next four years. My family moved to the United 
              States of America in 2000, and we settled in New Jersey. In 2012, I became a 
              proud citizen of my adopted country. Now, I live in New Brunswick, NJ.

              I was hired by Local Wisdom in May of 2012 to work in Research and Development, 
              namely their Weatherwise and Photomash applications. For the current Weatherwise 
              2.0, I implemented the Theme Store, where users can purchase different themes for 
              the app. For the upcoming Weatherwise 3.0 update, I implemented the app's animation 
              engine across platforms and a Mac application to create Weatherwise themes. I have 
              also worked with the Green Party of New Jersey, student organizations, and friends in 
              building websites.

              I earned an Associate's Degree in Liberal Arts from Mercer County Community 
              College during my last two years of high school. Transferring to Rutgers University 
              in the ensuing Spring of 2012, I declared as both a Computer Science and Philosophy 
              major. I am an active member of the Rutgers undergraduate philosophy community, 
              holding leadership positions in the Philosophy Club, Undergraduate Journal, and 
              Philosophy Honors Society. I graduate after the Fall of 2014, and I am applying 
              to graduate schools for philosophy.
